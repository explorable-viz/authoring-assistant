Thus at iteration k+1 we are using p\u03b8(w\u2223x;\u03ba,V\u03b8k,R\u03b8k) as the model selection criterion when we estimate the parameters \u03b8k+1. Starting from the mle, we run extended Baum-Welch 100 times. We observe the following: The logarithm of the approximate MMI criterion, logp\u03b8k(w\u2223x;\u03ba,V\u03b8k,R\u03b8k), reaches its peak value after [REPLACE id=\"result1\" value=\"?\"] iterations and then continues its oscillation."
