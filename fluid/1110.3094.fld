"""
	Overall the SVM with polynomial degree 1 kernel ${"outperformed"}  all other kernels with other kernels generally offering ${"better"}  precision at a  ${"higher"}  cost to recall. Precision (Positive predictive) values ranged from  ${minimum (getColumn "svm1_p" tableData)}  to  ${maximum (getColumn "svm1_p" tableData)} for SVM (polynomial degree 1) and from ${minimum (getColumn "naive_bayes_p" tableData)}  to  ${maximum (getColumn "naive_bayes_p" tableData)} for NB. Recall (sensitivity) values ranged from ${minimum (getColumn "svm1_r" tableData)}  to  ${maximum (getColumn "svm1_r" tableData)} for SVM (polynomial degree 1) and from  ${minimum (getColumn "naive_bayes_r" tableData)}  to  ${maximum (getColumn "naive_bayes_r" tableData)}  for NB. SVM tended to offer a  ${"reduced"}  level of precision but  ${"better"}  recall. In the case of one syndrome (Hemorrhagic) we noticed an unusually  ${"low"}  level of recall for SVM but not for NB.
