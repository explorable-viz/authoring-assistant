	Table 1 compares the performance of all model variants. The SHiP models significantly improved over the BOW baselines on the two diagnosis tasks (p < 0.001 under Welch's t-test): for CCS prediction, the  ${"best"}  SHiP models improved top-1 recall by  ${let ccsPredictionImprovement = 7.9 in numToStr ccsPredictionImprovement ++ " percentage points"}  and top-5 recall by  ${let top5RecallCCSPredictionImprovement = 4.8 in numToStr top5RecallCCSPredictionImprovement ++ " percentage points"} , respectively, over the  ${"best"}  BOW models; for ICD-9 prediction, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) increased by  ${let icd9AUPRCimprovement = 2.1 in numToStr icd9AUPRCimprovement ++ " percentage points"}  and weighted area under the ROC curve (AUROC) increased by  ${let aurocImprovement = 0.8 in numToStr aurocImprovement ++ " percentage points"} . For mortality prediction, we saw negligible benefit from the SHiP architecture. The SHiP models also improved over the corresponding hierarchical models without pretraining. For mortality, pretraining the all-features model increased AUPRC by  ${let improvement = 0.8 in numToStr improvement ++ " percentage points"}  (p =  ${numToStr 0.06} ) and AUROC by  ${let aurocImprovement = 0.6 in numToStr aurocImprovement ++ " percentage points"}  (p =  ${numToStr 0.004} ); for primary CCS, pretraining the all-feature model increased top-1 recall by  ${let improvement = 8.0 in numToStr improvement ++ " percentage points"}  (p <  ${numToStr 0.001} ), while pretraining the notes-only model increased top-5 recall by  ${let improvement = 4.7 in numToStr improvement ++ " percentage points"}  (p <  ${numToStr 0.001} ); for all ICD-9, pretraining the notes-only model increased AUPRC by  ${let improvement = 0.7 in numToStr improvement ++ " percentage points"}  (p =  ${numToStr 0.03} ) and weighted AUROC by  ${let aurocImprovementICD9 = 0.4 in numToStr aurocImprovementICD9 ++ " percentage points"}  (p =  ${numToStr 0.01} ).
