\begin{abstract}
We present a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation of an agent-based LLM framework for authoring
\emph{transparent text}, natural language articles which provide interactions allowing a reader to explore the
relationship to the underlying data. We evaluate our approach on a subset of SciGen, a dataset consisting of
tables from scientific articles and their corresponding descriptions.
