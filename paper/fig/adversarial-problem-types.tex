        false comparison &
        BiLSTM is \hl{the most efficient} among all models compared, with the highest model size &
        BiLSTM is not the most efficient, nor does it have the largest size. \\

        wrong numerical value &
        LSTM is the fastest model with overall time taken being \hl{90} seconds &
        It is not 90 but 106. \\

        ambiguous referent &
        LSTM is the fastest model with overall time taken being \hl{90} seconds &
        There are two type of time in the dataset (training\_time, execution\_time), both with a value of 90 seconds. \\
