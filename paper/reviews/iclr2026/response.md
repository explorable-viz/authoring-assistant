# Response to reviewers

We thank our three reviewers for their useful feedback and suggestions for improving the paper. We address
specific comments of each reviewer below, and then summarise our planned revisions to the paper.

## Reviewer AyvP

_Restriction to single papers._

Nothing about our design restricts it to single papers, although for our evaluation we have only considered
excerpts from single papers. A multi-paper setup is an interesting use case and one we will consider for
future work.

_Checks for more complex claims cannot be generated with LLMs._
