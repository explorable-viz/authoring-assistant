\section{AI-Assisted Authoring Workflow}
\label{sec:authoring-workflow}

Our authoring tool is composed of two LLM-based agents. A \textbf{\SuggestionAgent} identifies text fragments
potentially computable from data, and an \textbf{\InterpretationAgent}, given a candidate fragment identified by the
\SuggestionAgent or by the author, attempts to synthesise a Fluid expression which computes the target fragment. The
main components of the workflow are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Initial configuration.} The author imports the target text and accompanying data into the system to create
a syntactic representation of the target document. Initially this is simply equivalent to the target text, taking the
form of a string literal \kw{f"""..."""}, where the triple quotes are Fluid syntax for a Python-style \emph{interpolated
string}, i.e.~a literal where expressions of the form \kw{\{$e$\}} are permitted within the string. The \SuggestionAgent
analyses the target text and identifies any fragments which are candidates for being computed instead of remaining as
literal substrings.

\item \textbf{High-level Authoring workflow.} \todo{Perhaps define $\textbf{SynthOutcome} ::= \textbf{Match}(e) \mid
\textbf{NoMatch}(e,s) \mid \textbf{NoExpr}$?} The system then enters the human-in-the loop authoring workflow shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:interpretation-agent}, where the author interacts with the \InterpretationAgent. The system waits for
the author to select a fragment of text $s$ to interpret (perhaps previously highlighted by the \SuggestionAgent). The
system then attempts to generate a candidate Fluid expression $e$ using the closed-loop synthesis step (3) below. If
code synthesis succeeds with an expression $e$, the system proceeds to the manual validation step (4) below. If the
synthesis step fails with no expression, no remedial action is possible; this is considered an unsuccessful path through
the workflow and returns the system to the entry state. Otherwise the synthesis step produces an expression $e$ which
evaluates to a mismatched string $s' \neq s$ outcome, and the user can choose to manually abort and return to the entry
state, or optionally to \emph{revise the goal}, replacing $s$ with $s'$ in the target document and retaining $e$ as the
candidate expression. This is intended to cover the situation where the author has made a claim which is
\emph{incorrect}, and the dataset and surrounding natural language have led the LLM to synthesise an expression which
generates a different value from the one specified by the user.

\item \textbf{Code synthesis step.} The expression synthesis step is an error-guided iterative prompting
loop~\citep{skreta2023}, beginning with an initial prompt sent to the LLM (see \emph{Prompt design} below)
requesting the generation of an expression $e$. Using the Fluid command-line interface, the expression is
validated to check that it evaluates without error, produces a value coercible to a string $s'$, and finally
that $s'$ is equal to the target fragment $s$. Any failure triggers prompt augmentation with the appropriate
error message and the system retries generation. If code synthesis loop is able to yield an expression which
computes $s$ within a maximum number of retries, the synthesis step succeeds with $e$. If the last generated
$e$ was invalid (resulting in an error), the code synthesis step fails with no expression. Otherwise, code
synthesis produces an expression $e$ but with a mismatched string outcome $s' \neq s$.

\item \textbf{Manual validation step.} Once a candidate expression has been generated, the system replaces the
selected substring $s$ with the interpolation expression \kw{\{$e$\}}, creating a new (but only tentative)
document configuration. The author can republish the web page hosting the document and interact with the
proposed revision. As shown in \Secref{evaluation}, this is an important validation step that can reveal
errors in the generated expression. If the interactions look reasonable, the author can approve the new
document state; this is the primary successful path through the workflow and returns the system to the entry
state where it is waiting for another top-level interaction from the author. Otherwise, the author rejects the
proposed change and returns to the entry state without any change to the document.

\end{enumerate}

This human-in-the-loop design combines automated synthesis with validation and author oversight, providing a
substantial level of automation, but requiring the author to intervene at key steps to ensure correctness.

\paragraph{\InterpretationAgent prompt design.}

The \InterpretationAgent is guided by a structured system prompt that frames code generation as a precise
replacement task. The model receives the imported datasets, helper modules, and the current Fluid
representation of the paragraph, in which a text fragment is marked with the tag \kw{[REPLACE …]}. The task is
to substitute this placeholder with a Fluid expression that evaluates exactly to the target string,
reconstructing quantitative or comparative claims as data queries. To ensure integration with the workflow,
the output must consist solely of a syntactically valid Fluid expression, with no additional commentary. The
full prompt is given in~\appref{system-prompt:interpretation-agent}.
