\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a proof-of-concept system for authoring transparent, data-driven documents by combining LLM-based code synthesis with Fluid's provenance-tracking runtime. Our evaluation on SciGen shows that the approach can reliably link natural language claims to their underlying data, while also revealing common failure modes such as ambiguity and misleading input.

%\subsection{Future Work}
%\label{sec:conclusion:future-work}

Future work includes reducing reliance on predefined helper functions such as \kw{growShrink} and
\kw{trendWord}. While there is an advantage in using a predefined set of helpers (in that they offer a uniform
framework for interpreting a given scholarly document), we also aim to enable the system to operate in their
absence, for instance by turning ``definition not found'' errors into augmented prompts that trigger automatic
generation of missing definitions. We also plan to broaden the scope of supported artifacts, extending
interpretation to visualisations and intermediate datasets derived from cleansing or aggregation, and to cover
additional idioms such as cardinals, multiplicatives, rounding, and graded adjectives.

Another priority is improving integration and validation. Embedding
the system into developer and authoring environments such as VSCode or
Cursor would make the workflow more seamless, while automatic
generation of counterfactual test cases could strengthen validation at
authoring time. Finally, distinguishing between \emph{referential terms} with
fixed denotations and queries with data-dependent values may help in
repairing false or inconsistent statements, ensuring that generated
expressions remain aligned with both the data and the author's intent.

\section*{Reproducibility Statement}
To facilitate reproducibility, we provide a zip archive in the supplementary materials containing the complete source code,
the datasets used in our experiments, and a README file with detailed instructions for running the scripts.
