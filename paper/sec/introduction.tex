\section{Introduction: Transparent Documents}

Making sense of data-driven claims is hard, even if the evidence base (data sets and related analyses) is
open. We see this in peer review, misinformation, retracted papers, \rpnote{supporting citations}.
\rpnote{Small example here?}

Recent work on data provenance and data visualisation~\citep{psallidas18smoke,perera22,bond25} proposed more
transparent charts and figures by integrating interactive ``provenance queries'' directly into visual outputs.
These interactive queries allow readers to interact with visual elements to see the data relevant to those
elements. The key feature of these approaches is that the interactions are provided automatically, via
\emph{transparent programming languages} (either query languages or general-purpose languages) which track
dependencies as data flows through a computation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Making the text transparent, with the possibility to highlight the data related to a specific sentence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transparent Text via Interactive Provenance Queries}

In most articles, however, charts and figures usually only play a supporting role. The main claims are usually
presented in natural language, language which also makes quantitative statements and refers to ``behind the
scenes'' data analyses. In principle transparent programming languages can also be used to create natural
language which is bidirectly linked to data, by computing key fragments of natural language from data. The
following example, adapted from \cite{moosavi21}, shows how the language presented in this paper can be used
to achieve this:

\end{figure}

\input{fig/scigen-1805.02474v1-10-src}

We envisage two possible use cases for transparent text:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Authoring.} Someone authoring content for an online article, wants to create text
linked to raw data (and derivative data such as charts or tabular summaries), so that the evidence base for
the claims made in the text can be explored \emph{in situ}, by interacting with the text.

\item \textbf{Reading or reviewing.} Someone reading textual claims derived from open data (e.g. a
scientific paper or climate report), wants to retroactively link the text to queries over the available data
and gradually ``rationally reconstruct'' the relationship between the claims in the paper and the evidence
base. Perhaps just to aid their own comprehension, or to provide some kind of justified peer review.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Target idioms of natural language}

NLP aspect of the problem is potentially a big problem space in itself. We will restrict interest to certain
idiomatic uses of natural language in making/justifying scientific claims.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and proof-of-concept implementation of AI-assisted workflow for authoring transparent text
    (\secref{authoring-workflow})
    \item Empirical evaluation of how effective current LLMs are at providing the ``AI-assisted'' part
\end{itemize}
