\section{Target idioms of natural language}

\input{fig/natural-language-forms}

Table~\ref{tab:natural-language-forms} summarises the natural language idioms studied in this paper. With
state-of-the-art models like \gptfour and \gptfive, our system is able to resolve basic table lookups of direct
numerical values, as well as computations of percentages, averages, minima and maxima, and totals, each mapped
to the corresponding aggregation over the source data. For example, phrases such as \textfrag{the Energy
Sector accounts for 52.80\% of total emissions} and \textfrag{average methane emissions for 2030 is 13.51} are
interpreted in terms of sum and mean respectively over the relevant data values. Similarly, \textfrag{recorded
its highest emissions in 2030} is interpreted as a \kw{maximumBy} query, while a statement such as
\textfrag{CNN gives the lowest accuracy} is mapped to an explicit computation of rank.

We also consider \emph{trend} expressions, which comparative natural language phrases describing how a data
attribute evolves over time, such as \textfrag{training time growing from 67 to 106 seconds}. Such idioms are
mapped to higher-order functions like \kw{trendWord} parameterised on additional helper functions such as
\kw{growShrink} and \kw{betterWorse} (shown in \figref{fluid-scigen}) which map comparisons to appropriate
natural language phrases.

Taken together, these categories cover a representative portion of the numerical reasoning idioms found in the
\SciGen benchmark. However, some linguistic forms that commonly arise in scholarly articles are not covered in
our analysis. We have yet to study approximate quantitative terms like \textfrag{around 50\%} or
\textfrag{roughly 100 instances}, nor interval-based descriptions such as \textfrag{between 30 and 40\%} or
\textfrag{within 5–10 seconds}. While we have no reason for thinking these will present specific difficulties,
other forms are likely to be more challenging. So-called \emph{graded} modal adverbs~\citep{lassiter17} which
modify adjectival comparatives like \textfrag{better} -- as in \textfrag{slightly better} and
\textfrag{significantly higher} -- especially when combined with trends over time, as in \textfrag{steadily
increasing} or \textfrag{sharply declining} -- are likely to prove difficult because the interpretation of
these qualifiers can be subjective and context-dependent. Generalised quantifiers like \textfrag{generally}
and \textfrag{usually}~\citep{barwise81} present similar challenges because colloquial use may differ from
more formal uses (in some situations ``most'' might mean a majority, i.e.~greater than 50\% of cases, but in
others may mean only ``greater than any other alternative proportion''). On the other hand these difficulties
also present themselves to human readers, so extending coverage to these idioms would substantially deepen our
tool's ability to bridge natural language reporting with interpretation in terms of the underlying dataset,
perhaps revealing inconsistent use of technical language on the part of the author. We discuss this further in
\secref{conclusion:future-work}.
