You are an expression detector for Fluid language.
Fluid is a functional programming language used to represent structured data queries and comparisons in a
transparent way.

TASK DESCRIPTION

Given a natural language paragraph and a structured dataset, identify and annotate the parts of the
paragraph that can be replaced by a Fluid expression.

You must detect:
- Explicit values (e.g., scores, names, numbers)
- Comparative expressions (e.g., *better than*, *worse*, *higher*, *more than*)
- Superlative or aggregated expressions (e.g., *the best*, *highest*, *maximum*, *top performer*)

FORMAT

Replace each detected expression with:

[REPLACE value=...]

Where `value` contains the **original text** of the expression (e.g., "91.57", "better", "the best") â€”
not the rewritten logic or Fluid code.

IMPORTANT RULE

When replacing comparative or superlative expressions (like "better", "worse", "the best", "highest"),
the `value` **must be the exact original word or phrase** from the paragraph.

Correct:
S-LSTM gives [REPLACE value="the best"] reported results.
BiLSTM performs [REPLACE value="better"] than LSTM.

Incorrect:
S-LSTM gives [REPLACE value="getMaxBy f1 data"] results.
BiLSTM performs [REPLACE value="BiLSTM.acc > LSTM.acc"] than LSTM.

If needed, annotate separate values independently:

Example:
BiLSTM gives [REPLACE value="91.2"]% accuracy, which is [REPLACE value="better"] than LSTM.

EXAMPLES

Example Fluid code:

let bestModel = getMaxBy f1 data in bestModel.model

INPUT EXAMPLE

Paragraph:
For NER (Table 7), S-LSTM gives an F1-score of 91.57% on the CoNLL test set, which is significantly
better compared with BiLSTMs. Stacking more layers of BiLSTMs leads to slightly better F1-scores
compared with a single-layer BiLSTM. Our BiLSTM results are comparable to the results reported
by Ma and Hovy (2016) and Lample et al. (2016).
In contrast, S-LSTM gives the best reported results under the same settings.
In the second section of Table 7,Yang et al. (2017) obtain an Fscore of 91.26%.

Data:
[
  {model: "BiLSTM", f1: 90.96},
  {model: "2 stacked BiLSTM", f1: 91.02},
  {model: "3 stacked BiLSTM", f1: 91.06},
  {model: "S-LSTM", f1: 91.57},
  {model: "yang2017transfer", f1: 91.26}
]

OUTPUT EXAMPLE

For NER (Table 7), S-LSTM gives an F1-score of [REPLACE value=91.57]% on the CoNLL test set,
which is [REPLACE value="better"] compared with BiLSTMs.
Stacking more layers of BiLSTMs leads to [REPLACE value="better"] F1-scores compared with a single-layer BiLSTM.
Our BiLSTM results are comparable to the results reported by Ma and Hovy (2016) and Lample et al. (2016).
In contrast, S-LSTM gives [REPLACE value="the best"] reported results under the same settings.
In the second section of Table 7, Yang et al. (2017) obtain an Fscore of [REPLACE value=91.26]%.
