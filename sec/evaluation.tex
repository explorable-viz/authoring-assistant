\section{Empirical Evaluation}

\subsection{Research questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item How does performance degrade with partial/ambiguous information?
\item How is performance affected by ``adversarial'' (intentionally/unintentionally misleading information)?
\end{itemize}

Choosing different identifiers might be one way to explore these axes, but also swapping identifiers,
underspecifying queries (omitting the year), etc.

We might want to distinguish ambiguity inherent in the problem domain (e.g.~uncertainty) vs.~ambiguity in the
specification of a particular code-generation query.
