\section{Initial Experiments}
Here I shall document the inital experiments I have performed with both GPT, and
Google Gemini \citet{gemini2023}. 

\subsection{Haskell Examples in Chat GPT}
I began by working on with Chat-GPT (GPT-4o), using small Haskell examples, a later
experiment will determine how to perform the same experiments using \kw{fluid}.
I gave example programs, asked it to demonstrate similar ones, culminating in it
generating a partial accessor function.
