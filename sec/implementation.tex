\section{Implementation Considerations}
\label{sec:implementation}

Here we catalogue some of the considerations our implementation of this system has/will need.

\paragraph{Dictionaries:} in order to programmatically walk into potentially nested data structures.
Doing so is infeasible when working with records, since our language does not have a type system, 
or a way to dynamically construct symbols on the fly. Instead, we use dictionaries since we can
dynamically construct strings, and use these to walk into the fields of a dictionary structure.

\paragraph{Language integrated provenance:} in order for generated text to be easily linked to the
underlying program, it is important that the language an author uses to generate the text has a
model of data provenance tightly integrated into the language itself. This obviates the need for the
author to build their own interactivity features, instead the code which supplies the generated text
should automatically provide linking capability to the underlying data. 

\paragraph{Transparent multiverse:}
