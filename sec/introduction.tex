\section{Introduction}

Authoring of scientific articles is difficult and time-consuming. Taking such
an article and building interactive features requires a further investment of
effort, often on an ad-hoc basis. Extending this interactivity to work on text
is even more difficult, making interactive article writing impractical, despite
the clear benefits to transparency, and communication of information.

Some of the difficulty can be mitigated by building visualizations in a language
which provides automatic support for interaction, but these do not provide tools
or support for linking data directly to the text of an article. Scientific articles
will make reference to data consistently.
