Our work bears a strong similarity to the notion of explorable explanations \cite{victor11b}.
An explorable explanation as laid out by Victor is an interactive document that allows the reader to
explore a quantitative topic, by manipulating parameters of the underlying model, and observing how these
changes impact the results of the analysis in real time. The crucial difference with our work is that 
whilst an explorable exploration allows for the reader to explore a model and its implications, it may
not be transparent, in the sense of exposing the underlying model and its assumptions.

Further work on this line of thought includes \cite{dragicevic19} who introduce the idea of an
explorable multiverse analysis. Their work is aimed at answering the question of how robust a given
data analysis to changes in the underlying methodology. A multiverse analysis
