Our work bears a strong similarity to the notion of explorable explanations \cite{victor11b}.
An explorable explanation as laid out by Victor is an interactive document that allows the reader to
explore a quantitative topic, by manipulating parameters of the underlying model, and observing how these
changes impact the results of the analysis in real time. The crucial difference with our work is that 
whilst an explorable exploration allows for the reader to explore a model and its implications, it may
not be transparent, in the sense of exposing the underlying model and its assumptions.

Further work on this line of thought includes \cite{steegen16} who introduced the idea of a multiverse
analysis. Their work is aimed at answering the question of how robust a given data analysis to changes
in the underlying methodology. A multiverse analysis involves taking a given dataset, and applying 
multiple different analysis techniques to it, reporting on the difference in results across the various choices.
This was then taken further by \cite{dragicevic19}, wherein they authors build \textit{explorable} multiverse
analyses, allowing the user to toggle between the various methodological choices, and seeing their document
update itself in real time. Our work builds on this, with the constructed multiverse analysis documents also
having their own interactive features within a given set of choices.

Ours is the first work that we are aware of that includes interactive data exploration within a multiverse
analysis, allowing the user to explore intra-universe data depdendency, as opposed to simply surfacing
the changes in results across different choices of method, thus supporting our goal of data transparency .
