\section{Generating Fluid Code}
\label{sec:generate-fluid}

The first problem -- and one potentially without any research component -- is to be able
to generate \kw{fluid} programs that access the aggregate of data reference by the surrounding text.
To solve this problem we will need to accumulate some research on code-generation from LLM's.

\subsection{Modules}
We first need to identify the relevant ``tasks'' from the wider body of NLP/LLM literature,
since each task is likely to comprise a module of the overall system. Here we will attempt
to describe the modules required to completely characterize a language-model code-generation
system.

\paragraph*{Representation of \kw{fluid} programs}
Our tool will need to combine information from a natural language context (a \kw{LinkedText} list)
with a formal model of \kw{fluid} programs. Moreover, the natural language context (NLC) is
\textit{is itself a value in a fluid program}.
