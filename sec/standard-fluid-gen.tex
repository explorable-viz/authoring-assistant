\section{Generating Fluid Code}
\label{sec:generate-fluid}

The first problem -- and one potentially without any research component -- is to be able
to generate \kw{fluid} programs that access the aggregate of data reference by the surrounding text.
To solve this problem we will need to accumulate some research on code-generation from LLM's.

\subsection{Relevant NLP tasks}
We first need to identify the relevant ``tasks'' from the wider body of NLP/LLM literature.
Beyond the general problem area of ``LLM's for code generation'', the process of analyzing the
text, and producing an explanatory expression that is relevant to the text and semantics of \kw{fluid}
will comprise of several connected stages, some of which are likely to correspond to well-studied
problems in modern NLP.
