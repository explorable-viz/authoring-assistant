    "value": "We designed ESE to output thirty candidate entities (NPs) ranked based on the similarity to the seed term. Therefore, we calculated precision at k (p@k) where k is always 30.  Table 2 shows the best results when using the feature ensemble method which is more stable than the non-ensemble one (due to lower standard deviation and non-zero precision). According to the results, the best combination in terms of the mean and standard deviation is obtained when using TFIDF (Eq.5) to weigh the edges and context-dependent similarity (Eq.8) to rank NPs. This shows that the uniqueness and the significant overlap of features between noun phrases were very important."
