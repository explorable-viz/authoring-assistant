From Table 2, we consistently see +.95/+1.00 BLEU/METEOR improvements between the best variants of our model and the sentence-level baseline across the three lan  For German→English, guage pairs. For French→English, all variants of document NMT model show comparable performance when using BLEU; however, when evaluated using METEOR, the dual memory model is the best. the target memory variants give comparable results, whereas for Estonian→English, the dual memory variant proves to be the best. Overall, the Memory-toContext model variants perform better than their Memory-to-Output counterparts."
