The highest-performing system for each is reported in Table 4.  On its own, the biLSTM with linear topology (L-biLSTM) performs  consistently better than the biLSTM with tree topology (T-biLSTM). However, the hybrid topology (H-biLSTM), consisting of both a L- and TbiLSTM is the top-performing system on UW for correlation (Table 4).  Though our methods achieve state of the art in the single-task setting, the best performing systems are mostly multi-task (Table 4 and Supplementary Materials)."
