In most cases, the L-biLSTM's mean prediction is closer to the true mean. This appears to arise in part because the T-biLSTM is less confident in its predictions – i.e. its mean prediction tends to be closer to 0. This results in the L-biLSTM being too confident in certain cases – e.g. in the case of the xcomp governing relation, where the T-biLSTM mean prediction is closer to the true mean."
