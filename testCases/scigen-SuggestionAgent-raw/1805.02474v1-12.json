As shown in Table 5, among the 16 datasets  S-LSTM gives the best results on 12, compared with BiLSTM and 2 layered BiLSTM models. The average accuracy of S-LSTM is 85.6%, significantly higher compared with 84.9% by 2-layer stacked BiLSTM. 3-layer stacked BiLSTM gives an average accuracy of 84.57%, which is lower compared to a 2-layer stacked BiLSTM, with a training time per epoch of 423.6 seconds."
