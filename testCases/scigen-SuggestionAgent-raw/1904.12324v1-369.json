Roughly 30% of the triples (104M) in OPIEC are clean according to the above constraints. Table 2 shows that clean triples are generally shorter on average and tend to have a higher confidence score than the full set of triples in OPIEC.  About 49% of all triples in OPIEC contain some sort of semantic annotation (cf. Tab. 2); in OPIEC-Linked, the fraction increases to 58%. Most of the semantic annotations referred to quantities, space or time; these annotations provide important context for the extractions. There is a significantly smaller amount of negative polarity and possibility modality annotations. One reason for the lack of such annotations may be in the nature of the Wikipedia articles, which aim to contain encyclopedic, factual statements and are thus more rarely negated or hedged."
