The score difference is larger  for AIDA-CoNLL test set than for the other 5 test sets.  Additionally we train our model on AIDA-CoNLL, producing its fully-supervised version ('AIDA CoNLL' row in Table 2). Though, as expected, this version is more accurate on AIDA test set, similarly to other fully-supervised methods, it overfits and does not perform that well on the 5 out-of-domain test sets."
