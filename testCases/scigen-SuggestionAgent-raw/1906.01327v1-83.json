Results on the new objects comparison dataset we created are shown in the rightmost column of Table 4.  We get better results than previous methods on this dataset: 63% and 61% accuracy on the dev/test sets compared to 60% and 57%. These relatively low results on this new dataset indicate that it is more challenging."
