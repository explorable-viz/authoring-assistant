We submitted three runs to the WMT19 biomedical task for each language pair: the best single all-biomed model, a uniform ensemble of models on two en-de and three es-en domains, and an ensemble with Bayesian Interpolation. Tables 3 and 4 give validation and test scores.  that a uniform multi-domain ensemble performs well, giving 0.5-1.2 BLEU improvement on the test set over strong single models.  We see small gains from using BI with ensembles on most validation sets, but only on en2es test.  we noted that, in general, we could predict BI (α = 0.5) performance by comparing the uniform ensemble with the oracle model performing best on each validation domain.  For en2es uniform ensembling underperforms the health and bio oracle models on their validation sets, and the uniform ensemble slightly underperforms BI on the test data."
