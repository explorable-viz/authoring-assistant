We notice that M.1 (Bag-of-words + Logistic Regression) and M.2 (BiLSTM) show a statistically significant difference between the two genders, with higher predicted positive class probabilities for sentences with female nouns.  On the contrary, M.3 (BERT) shows that sentences with male nouns have a statistically significant higher predicted positive class probability than sentences with female nouns."
