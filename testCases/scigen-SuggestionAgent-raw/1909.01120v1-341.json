We also test our local embeddings in the supervised setting with a state of the art ER system (DeepERL), comparing its results to the ones obtained with pre-trained embeddings (DeepERP ).  Results in Table 4 show that EmbDI embeddings obtain better quality results in all scenarios in both settings. As observed in the SM experiments, using local embeddings instead of pre-trained ones increases significantly the quality of an existing system. In this case, supervised DeepER shows an average 6% absolute improvement in F-measure in the tested setting with 5% of the ground truth passed as training data. The improvements decreases to 4% with more training data (10%). Also for ER, the local embeddings obtained with the basic method lead to 0 row matched.  Execut"
