Note that the DCT-based model, DCT*, described in Kayal and Tsatsaronis (2019) performed relatively poorly in all tasks, while our model achieved close to state-of-the-art performance in both the 20-NG and R-8 tasks. Our model outperformed EignSent on all tasks and generally performed better than or on par with p-means, ELMo, BERT, and EigenSent⊕Avg on both the 20-NG and R-8. On the other hand, both EigenSent⊕Avg and ELMo performed better than all other models on SST-5."
