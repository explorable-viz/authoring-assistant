Moreover, combining the two representations further improves the performance results. Based on the observation, we realize that even if Syntactic-HAN achieves a comparable performance results combining it with Lexical-HAN, slightly improves the overall performance (Style-HAN). As shown in Table IV, the performance improvement in terms of accuracy is consistent across all the benchmark datasets (4.54% in CCAT10, 2.85% in CCAT50, 2.02% in BLOGS10, 1.42% in BLOGS50)"
