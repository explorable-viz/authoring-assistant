Specifically, we show the number of phrase pairs extracted by ESSENTIA and FSA from both datasets (\"# of extracted pairs\" column), number of valid paraphrases within these pairs (\"# of valid pairs\" column), and precision (\"Precision\" column). Although FSA has higher precision due to conservative sentence alignment, ESSENTIA extracts significantly more paraphrases, improving the recall by 460% (Snips) and 247% (HotelQA) over the baseline."
