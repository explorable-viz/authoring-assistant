Using only team-level information, and no information about players gives worse but still decent BLEU scores.  Week day, player position or team-level aggregated scores can be removed without hurting BLEU. However, information about next games seems useful. Interestingly, relying on position only and removing most tags (e.g.,  ,  ) seems to be fine. In this case, we also print all-zero stats, for the position of each statistic to be consistent across players and games."
