Comparing ENT-SENT, ENT-DYM and ENT-ONLY, we see that the pooling methods over the whole sentence (i.e., ENT-SENT and ENT-DYM) are significantly better than ENT-ONLY that only focuses on the two entity mentions of interest in the DDI-2013 dataset. This is true across different deep learning models in this work. Comparing ENT-SENT and ENT-DYM, their performance are comparable in DDI-2013 (except for CNN where ENT-DYM is better). Comparing the syntax-based pooling methods and the non-syntax pooling methods, the pooling based on dependency paths (i.e., ENT-DEP0) is worse than the non-syntax pooling methods (i.e., ENT-SENT and ENT-DYM) and perform comparably with ENT-ONLY in the DDI-2013 dataset over all the models (except for the CNN model where ENT-ONLY is much worse)."
