To illustrate the need of pre-trained character embeddings, we see from III that using a pre-trained embedding increases the accuracy across datasets and the different number of authors, regardless of the amount of data for each author.  increase the performance a few degrees.  we analyzed the importance of pretrained character embedding for author attribution and showed that pre-training can result in better performances."
