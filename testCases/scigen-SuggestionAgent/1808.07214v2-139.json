Looking more closely at the other features, it is surprising that identity of the letters is not crucial, as long as we have access to dictionary lookup using the letters. Nevertheless, removing letter identity impacts especially boundary recall, perhaps  does not break down drastically. The impact on Wiki5k is stronger, possibly because the necessary memorization of familiar contexts is less effective out of domain. because some letters receive identical lookup values (e.g. single letter prepositions such as b 'in', l 'to') but have different segmentation likelihoods. The 'vowel' features, though ostensibly redundant with letter identity, help a little, causing "
