Of these, about 32 sentences (60% of the improvement) correspond to A-but-B and negation style sentences,  As further evidence that ELMo helps on these specific constructions, the non-ELMo baseline model (no-project, no-distill) gets 255 sentences wrong in the test corpus on average, only 89 (34.8%) of which are A-but-B style or negations."
