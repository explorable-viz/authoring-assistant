    "value": "Unfortunately, even at just 1k vocabulary items, BPE has already lost a BLEU point with respect to the character model.  Comparing the performance of our Pooled BiLSTM model against BPE, we notice that for a comparable level of compression (BPE size of 1k), BPE out-performs the pooled model by around 0.5 BLEU points. At a similar level of performance (BPE size of 4k), BPE has significantly shorter sequences.  As shown in table 6, the 3-HM configuration achieves much better compression even when this is accounted for, and also gives slightly better performance than 2-HM. In general, HM gating results in less compression but better performance than the fixed-stride techniques."
