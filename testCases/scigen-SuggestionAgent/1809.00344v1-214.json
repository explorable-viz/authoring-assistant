We also observe that, for all language-pairs, both translation directions benefit from context,  On the other hand, for the Subtitles data, we see a maximum improvement of +0.30 BLEU for InitDec+AddDec.  The next set of experiments evaluates the five different approaches for computing the sourceside context. from Table 2 that for English-Estonian and English-German, our model indeed benefits from using is evident  Finally, our results with source, target and dual contexts are reported. Interestingly, just using the source context is sufficient for English-Estonian and English-German. For English-French, on the other hand, we see significant improvements for the models using the target-side conversation history over using only the source-side.  Unlike Europarl, for Subtitles, we see improvements for our Src-TgtMix dual context variant over the Src-Tgt one for En→Ru,  To summarise, for majority of the cases our Language-Specific Sentence-level Attention is a winner or a close second. Using the Target Context is useful when the base model generates reasonable-quality translations; otherwise, using the Source Context should suffice."
