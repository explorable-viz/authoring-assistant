Intermediate training on generation tasks such as MT and SkipThought significantly impairs BERT's transfer ability. We speculate that this degradation may be due to catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning for a task substantially different from the tasks BERT was originally trained on. This phenomenon might be mitigated in our ELMo models via the frozen encoder and skip connection. On the test set, we lag slightly behind the BERT base results from Devlin et al. (2019), likely due in part to our limited hyperparameter tuning."
