The correlations reflect the degree to which the performance on one target task with some encoder predicts performance on another target task with the same encoder. See Appendix D for the full table and similar tables for intermediate ELMo and BERT experiments. Many correlations are low, suggesting that different tasks benefit from different forms of pretraining to a substantial degree, and bolstering the observation that no single pretraining task yields good performance on all target tasks. For reasons noted earlier, the models that tended to perform "
