On actual data from TBC, the outside language model is about as perplexed as on the BERT generations, which suggests that domain shift is an issue in using a trained language model for evaluating generations and that the GPT generations might have collapsed to fairly generic and simple sentences. The perplexity on BERT samples is not absurdly high, and in reading the samples, we find that many are fairly coherent."
