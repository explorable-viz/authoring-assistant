    "value": "Table 8 shows the BLEU scores achieved by several reasonable combinations of six-way pseudo-parallel data. We observed that the use of all six-way pseudo-parallel data (#10) significantly improved the base model for all the translation directions, except En→Ru. A translation direction often benefited when the pseudo-parallel data for that specific direction was used.  However, the resulting BLEU scores for Ja→Ru and Ru→Ja tasks do not exceed 10 BLEU points, implying the inherent limitation of the in-domain data as well as the difficulty of these translation directions.  models of our multistage fine-tuning, i.e., V and VII, achieved significantly higher BLEU scores than (b3) in Table 5, a weak baseline without using any monolingual data, and #10 in Table 8, a strong baseline established with monolingual data."
