We believe this difficulty can be mainly attributed to the complexity introduced by the position. For example in adjective-noun composition, the adjective always takes the first position, and the noun the second. However, in compounds the same noun can occur in both positions throughout different training examples. Consider for example the compounds boat house and house boat. In boat house \u2013 a house to store boats \u2013 the meaning of house is shifted towards shelter for an inanimate object, whereas house boat selects from house aspects related to human beings and their daily lives happening on the boat. These positionrelated differences can make it more challenging to create composed representations. that makes adverbadjective easier is the high dataset frequency of some of the adverbs/adjectives.
