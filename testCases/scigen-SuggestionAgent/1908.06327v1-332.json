The first lines of Table 3 report the results of the original fixed GrOVLE embedding, which should be considered the baseline. The second line of Table 3 reports performance when the four-task pretrained GrOVLE is fixed when used in the target task, i.e. the task currently being run. The third and fourth line of Table 3 report the results of our embedding when they were trained on all five tasks, and kept fixed or fine-tuned for the target task, respectively.  The results of line three and four demonstrate that our improved embedding tends to transfer better when applied with fine-tuning during the target task.
