BERT with weights initialized from normal distribution and further fine-tuned for a given task consistently produces lower scores than the ones achieved with pre-trained BERT. In fact, for some tasks (STS-B and QNLI), initialization with random weights yields worse performance than pre-trained BERT without fine-tuning."
