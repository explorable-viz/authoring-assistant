The experimental results demon strate that our proposed syntactic representation (POS-CNN outperforms the previously proposed method (ST-CNN) by the benchmark datasets (38.6% in a large margin in all CCAT10, 30.80% in CCAT50, 19.62% in BLOGS10, 11.94% in BLOGS50). This improvement in performance can be due  syntactic representations are kept identical. According to Table III, POS-HAN outperforms POS-CNN model consistently across all the benchmark datasets (1.74% in CCAT10, 0.32% in CCAT50, 1.06% in BLOGS10, 2.91% in BLOGS50). This"
