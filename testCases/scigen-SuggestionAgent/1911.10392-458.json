We then supply the vector representation of each utterance to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for domain and intent identification, and to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for slot filling. Second, we encode words in a dialogue utterance by GLoVe, as benchmark pre-trained word embeddings, to include the semantic relationships among words. We compute the average of word embeddings in an utterance to represent the utterance by a vector. "
