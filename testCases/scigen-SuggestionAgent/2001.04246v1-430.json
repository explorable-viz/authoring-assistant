Further, the performance degradation is quite significant across different kinds of tasks (for example, applying the searched structures of sentiment classification tasks to entailment recognition task, or vice verse), while the performance degradations within the same kind  of tasks (for example, MRPC and QQP for semantic equivalence classification) are relatively small, since they have the same input format (i.e., a pair of sentences) and similar targets.
