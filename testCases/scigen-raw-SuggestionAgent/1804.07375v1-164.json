Written data constitutes the large bulk of material, primarily from newswire (Wall Street Journal data), as well as some data from the Web and the New Testament, and some translations of news and online discussions in Arabic and Chinese. The translated data has been placed in its own category: it behaves more conservatively in preferring strict agreement than non-translated language (see Section 4.2), perhaps due to translators' editorial practices. The spoken data comes primarily from television broadcasts, including dialogue data from MSNBC, Phoenix and other broadcast sources (bc.conv), or news, from CNN, ABC and others (bc.news), as well as phone conversations."
