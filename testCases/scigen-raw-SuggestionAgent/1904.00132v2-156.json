However, from the dev set (Table 2) we know that the proportions of each of the emotion categories are better described as %5 each, thereby we use %5 as the empirical estimation of distribution Pte(xtr i ). We did not use the exact proportion of dev set as the estimation to prevent the overfitting towards dev set. The sample distribution of the train set is used as Ptr(xtr i )."
