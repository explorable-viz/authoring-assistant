The random-number baseline achieves a precision of 5% (has part), 3.5% (admin. territ. entity), 0% (spouse) and 11.2% (child). Compared to that, especially using only-nummod, our method gives encouraging results for has part, admin. territ. entity and child, with 30-50% precision and around 30% F1-score.  As shown by the last row of Table 2, higher quality of training data can considerably boost the performance of cardinality extraction."
