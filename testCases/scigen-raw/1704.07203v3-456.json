In particular, as opposed to the in-domain experiments, the difference of the Claim-F1 measure between the feature-based approaches and the deep learning approaches is striking. In the feature-based approaches, on average, a combination of all features yields the best results for both Macro-F1 and Claim-F1. When comparing single features, lexical ones do the best job."
