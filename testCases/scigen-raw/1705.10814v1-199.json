The general trend in the results is that the improvements of both models in the OOV case are larger than in the IV case, which means that the character composition models indeed alleviates the OOV problem. Also, CNN improves on seven languages in the IV case and eight languages in the OOV case, and it performs consistently better than LSTM in both cases."
