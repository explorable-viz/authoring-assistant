The models demonstrate similar performance on small data, but Char-CNN scales significantly better on medium-sized data. From the three syllable-aware models, Syl-Concat looks the most advantageous as it demonstrates stable results and has the least  number of parameters. Therefore in what follows we will make a more detailed comparison of SylConcat with Char-CNN."
