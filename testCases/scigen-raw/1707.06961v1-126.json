      "value": "Table 7 presents the POS tagging improvements that MIMICK achieves over the pre-trained Polyglot models, with and without CHAR→TAG concatenation, with 10,000 tokens of training data. We obtain statistically significant improvements in most languages, even when CHAR→TAG is included. These improvements are particularly substantial for test-set tokens outside the UD training set, as shown in the right two columns. While test set OOVs are a strength of the CHAR→TAG model (Plank et al., 2016), in many languages there are still considerable improvements to be obtained from the application of MIMICK initialization."
