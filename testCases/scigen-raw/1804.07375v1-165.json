The matrix makes it clear that the classifier is very good at avoiding errors against the majority class: it almost never guesses 'notional' when it shouldn't. Conversely, about 1/3 of actual notional cases are misclassified, predicted to be 'strict'. Among the erroneous cases, only 6 belong to Type III (about 15% of errors) , showing that the classifier largely handles this type quite well next to the other types, since Type III covers about 20% of plural-to-singular agreement cases."
