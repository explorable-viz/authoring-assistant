To our knowledge, ours are the only (unsupervisedly) inducing and employing more than one relations on this dataset. The others use only one relation, coreference, which is given by simple heuristics or supervised third-party resolvers. All four our models outperform any previous method, with ment-norm achieving the best results, 0.85% higher than that of Ganea and Hofmann (2017).  The experimental results show that ment-norm outperforms rel-norm, and that mention padding plays an important role."
