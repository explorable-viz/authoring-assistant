With gold-standard segmentation, our word-based methods give competitive results to the state-of-the-art on the dataset (Che et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013),  In addition, the results show  that our word-based models can serve as highly competitive baselines. With automatic segmentation, the F1-score of word+char+bichar LSTM decreases from 75.77% to 71.70%, showing the influence of segmentation to NER. Consistent with observations on the development set, adding lattice word information leads to an 88.81% → 93.18% increasement of F1-score over the character baseline, as compared with 88.81% → 91.87% by adding bichar+softword. The lattice model gives significantly the best F1-score on automatic segmentation."
