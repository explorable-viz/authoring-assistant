In terms of BLEU scores, DialogWAE (with a Gaussian mixture prior network) generates more relevant responses, with the average recall of 42.0% and 37.2% on both of the datasets. These are significantly higher than those of the CVAE baselines (29.9% and 26.5%). We observe a similar trend to the BOW embedding metrics."
