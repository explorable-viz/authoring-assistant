            "value": "Table 2 compares the accuracy of our model on the test data with two baselines and two state-of-theart comparable systems. The MT baseline simply consists of the accuracy of the mt sentences with respect to the pe ground truth. The other baseline is given by a statistical PE (SPE) system (Simard et al., 2007) chosen by the WMT17 organizers. Table 2 shows that when our model is trained with only the 11K WMT17 official training sentences, it cannot even approach the baselines. Even when the 12K WMT16 sentences are added, its accuracy is still well below that of the baselines. However, when the 500K artificial data are added, it reports a major improvement and it outperforms them both significantly. In addition, we have compared our model with two recent systems that have used our  same training settings (500K artificial triplets + 23K manual triplets oversampled 10 times), reporting a slightly higher accuracy than both (1.43 TER and 1.93 BLEU p.p. over (Varis and Bojar, 2017) and 0.21 TER and 0.30 BLEU p.p. over (B´erard et al., 2017)). Since their models explicitly predicts edit operations rather than post-edited sentences, we speculate that these two tasks are of comparable intrinsic complexity."
