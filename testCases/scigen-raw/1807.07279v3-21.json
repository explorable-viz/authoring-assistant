It can be seen that the alternative approaches that aim to improve interpretability, have poor performance on the word analogy tests. However, our proposed method has comparable performance with the original GloVe embeddings. Our proposed method outperforms GloVe in semantic analogy test set and in overall results, while GloVe performs slightly better in syntactic test set."
