      "value": "To investigate the effect of the additional cost term on the performance improvement in the semantic analogy test, we  present Table VIII. In particular, we present results for the cases where i) all questions in the dataset are considered, ii) only the questions that contains at least one concept word are considered, iii) only the questions that consist entirely of concept words are considered.  We observe that for all three scenarios, our proposed algorithm results in an improvement in the precision scores. However, the greatest performance increase is seen for the last scenario, which underscores the extent to which the semantic features captured by embeddings can be improved with a reasonable selection of the lexical resource from which the concept wordgroups were derived."
