The WEBSPLIT model scores 35.3 BLEU on the WebSplit validation set but fails to generalize beyond its narrow domain, as evidenced by reaching only 4.2 BLEU on the WikiSplit validation set.  In contrast, the WIKISPLIT model achieves 59.4 BLEU on the WebSplit validation set,  Reintroducing the downsampled, in-domain training data (BOTH) further improves performance on the WebSplit evaluation."
