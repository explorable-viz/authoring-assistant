      "value": "Table 2 shows a selection of the f1-scores achieved on properties in the CSLB dataset in relation to the average cosine similarity of the associated words. A high average cosine similarity means that the concepts overall have similar vector representations and can thus be seen as having a low diversity. The results of the Spearman Rank correlation clearly indicate that scores achieved by nearest neighbors correlate more strongly with the average cosine than the two supervised classification approaches."
