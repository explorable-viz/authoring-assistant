      "value": "Table 7 shows our manual evaluation of the top 30 hypotheses for 10 random E2E test inputs generated by models trained with data synthesized from the two templates. As is evident from the first two rows, all models learned to generalize from the training data to produce correct texts for novel inputs consisting of unseen combinations of input attributes.  Yet, the picture is a bit different for the model trained on data generated by both templates. While the top two hypotheses are equally distributed between adhering to Template 1 and Template 2, more than 5% among the lower-ranked hypotheses constitute a template combination such as the example shown in the bottom part of Figure 2.  As can be seen in the final row of Table 7, this simple reranker successfully places correct hypotheses higher up in the ranking, improving the practical usability of the generation model by now offering almost three correct variants for each input among the top five hypotheses on average."
