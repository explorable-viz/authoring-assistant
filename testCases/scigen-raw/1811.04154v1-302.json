However, we see relatively lower improvement in accuracy with Somali-Oromo than Amharic-Tigrinya.  the supervised TRANS model, which uses Wikipedia parallel data in the LRL itself as a lexicon, does not perform better than the zero-shot PBEL.  The PBEL model results for our test set with each input representation are presented in Table 3."
