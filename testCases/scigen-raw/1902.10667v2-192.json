      "value": "we show the superior performance (in terms of MWE-based F-score) of our top systems on the test data compared to the baseline and stateof-the-art systems, namely, ATILF-LLF (Al Saied et al., 2017) and SHOMA (Taslimipoor and Rohanian, 2018). GCN works the best for discontinuous MWEs in EN and FA, while H-combined outperforms based on results for all MWEs except for FA.  The overall results confirm our assumption that a hybrid architecture can mitigate errors of individual models and bolster their strengths."
