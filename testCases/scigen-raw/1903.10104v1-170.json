CNN performs better for types with significantly more training samples, i.e., evaluation and fact, indicating the effect of data size on neural model's performance. Joint models (CRF-joint and BiLSTM-CRF-joint) yield the best F1 scores for all categories when gold-standard segmentation is unavailable."
