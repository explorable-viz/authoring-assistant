We can see a decrease in performance when adding French that is not present with other languages. Otherwise, every time we add a new language the recall for this language logically increase. The best performance is achieved with English+French+German+Czech, with an increase of 6.42 % for multilingual retrieval.  By using MUSE embeddings, we are able to embed more languages in the same model. We showed that adding other languages decrease performance for English, but increase the recall in a multilingual environment."
