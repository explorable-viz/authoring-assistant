      "value": "With BIVEC embeddings, we learn two languages at the same time, and test retrieval on one or two of these languages. Results are shown in table 4. Trained in English alone, the model gives worse performance than  MUSE for languages not seen previously. For example, with English-German BIVEC and a model trained only in English, and test on German, we obtain only 22.96 % recall@10, where MUSE embeddings obtain 44.18 %. But when train on English and French, we obtain 55.22 % recall, an increase of 26.39 % compared to MUSE. With German and English training, we have an increase of 15.16 % on English only recall, with a recall of 61.44 %. Meaning that, once again, learning a new language with BIVEC enables better results in English, as the same kind of results is visible with French as well."
