The performance of SLD and SL are very close to each other, on the dev set, SLD performs better than SL but they have almost the same overall scores on the test set. The MacroF1 scores of each emotion category are very different from each other: the classification accuracy for emotion Sad is the highest in most of the cases, while the emotion Happy is the least accurately classified by all the models. We also noticed that the performance on the dev set is generally slightly better than that on the test set."
