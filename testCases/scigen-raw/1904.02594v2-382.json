Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 1.6% on SwDA, the primary dataset for this task, and comes within 0.6% on MRDA. It also beats a TF-IDF GloVe baseline (described in Section 5.2) by 16.4% and 12.2%, respectively.  The improvements that the model is able to make over the other methods are significant, however, the gains on MRDA still fall short of the state-of-the-art by 0.6%."
