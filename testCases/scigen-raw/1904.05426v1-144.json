      "value": "Table 2 presents the intrinsic performance of the cipher grounder over all PL-CL pairs considered. The difference between the best and the worst performing PL for each CL ranges from 24.62 percentage points for Swahili to 48.34 points for French, and an average difference of 34.5 points among all languages.  The case when PL=CL is also presented in Table 2 as a reference and provides a reliable upper-bound under zero-resource conditions.  It is worth noting the difference in accuracy when comparing the best performing PL for each CL with its corresponding PL=CL upper-bound.  Among all CLs, the best cipher grounder for French (es-fr) gets the closest to its upper-bound with just 4.81 percentage points of difference, followed by the English grounder (fr-en) with 13.53 points of difference.  As shown in Table 2, this model, CIPHER-AVG, obtains accuracy scores of 56.4, 58.6, 37.4, and 37.8 % for en, fr, fa, and sw, respectively.  When compared to the best performing PL for each CL (see bold cells in Table 2), it can be noticed that the performance gap ranges from just 1.2 percentage points for Swahili to 13.3 points for French, with an average of 6.1 points among all target languages."
