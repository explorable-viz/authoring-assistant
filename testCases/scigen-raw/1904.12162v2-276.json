We can see that the number of correct predictions are higher with our method in all three datasets, and our method achieved the highest F1 values for all three positive, all three negative, and one neutral.  In summary, our method using n-gram IDF and automated machine learning (auto-sklearn) largely outperformed existing sentiment analysis tools."
