Somewhat expectedly, the best overall F score (.945) is produced in the setting Both, which provides the most information. Actually, this is true for all four weighting schemes for both GloVe and Google, while fastText consistently yields its top F scores (.840 - .911) in the Label setting, which provides the least information."
