      "value": "Table 1 compares the performance of these systems on the development set. Our model with no augmentation already matches the system of Choi et al. (2018) with augmentation, and incorporating ELMo gives further gains on both precision and recall. On top of this model, adding the distantly-annotated data lowers the performance; the loss function-based approach of (Choi et al., 2018) does not sufficiently mitigate the noise in this data. However, denoising makes the distantlyannotated data useful, improving recall by a substantial margin especially in the general class.  BERT performs similarly to ELMo with denoised distant data. As can be seen in the performance breakdown, BERT gains from improvements in recall in the fine class."
