The HEAD examples have more general types added than the EL examples since the noisy HEAD labels are typically finer. Fine-grained types are added to both EL and HEAD examples less frequently. Ultra-fine examples are frequently added to both datasets, with more added to EL;  The filtering function discards similar numbers of examples for the EL and HEAD data: 9.4% and 10% respectively."
