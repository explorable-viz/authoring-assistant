In this case, we see that BT alone hurts performance compared to the strong bitext baseline, but NoisedBT indeed surpasses the bitext model.  It is worth noting that our numbers are lower than those reported by Edunov et al. (2018) on the years they report (36.1, 43.8, and 40.9 on 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively).  On WMT16 EnRo, TaggedBT improves on vanilla BT by 0.4 BLEU."
