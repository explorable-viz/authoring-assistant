VecEval (Nayak et al., 2016) is another web based suite for static English word embeddings that perform evaluation on a set of downstream tasks which may take several hours.  K¨ohn (2015) introduced an offline, multilingual probing suite for static embeddings limited in terms of the languages and the probing tasks.  A comparison of the system features of previous studies is given in Table 1."
