All models perform relatively well on FEVER DEV but achieve less than 60% accuracy on the synthetic ones.  The re-weighting method increases the accuracy of the ESIM and BERT models by an absolute 3.4% and 3.3% respectively. One can notice that this improvement comes at a cost in the accuracy over the FEVER DEV pairs.  Applying the regularization method, using the same training data, helps to train a more robust model that performs better on our test set, where verification in context is a key requirement."
