STSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores.  due to the fact that the directness has only two labels and multilabeling is not allowed in this task. Tasks involving imbalanced data, multiclass and multilabel annotations harm the performance of the directness in multitask settings.  Since macro-F1 is the average of all F1 scores of individual labels, all deep learning models have high macro-F1 scores in English which indicates that they are particularly good at classifying the direct class. STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of microF1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.  Except for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it.  MTML settings do not lead to a big improvement which may be due to the class imbalance, multilabel tasks, and the difference in the nature of the tasks."
