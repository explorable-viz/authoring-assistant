We can see that replacing softmax by entmax does not hurt performance in any of the datasets; indeed, sparse attention Transformers tend to have slightly higher BLEU, but their sparsity leads to a better potential for analysis. In the next section, we make use of this potential by exploring the learned internal mechanics of the self-attention heads."
