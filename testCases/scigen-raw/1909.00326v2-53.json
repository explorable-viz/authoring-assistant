Fertility can be categorized into 4 types: one-to-many (\"≥ 2\"), one-to-one (\"1\"), many-to-one (\"(0, 1)\"), and null-aligned (\"0\"). Syntactic depth shows the depth of a word in the dependency tree. A lower tree depth indicates closer to the root node in the dependency tree, which might indicate a more important word."
