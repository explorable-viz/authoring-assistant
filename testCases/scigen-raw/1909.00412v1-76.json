The results show that social information helps improve the performance on Stance and Hate Speech detection, while it has no effect for Sentiment Analysis.  LING+random never improves over LING:  We find that both PV and N2V user representations lead to an improvement over LING.  where LING+N2V outperforms LING+PV,  while for Hate Speech the performance of the two models is comparable (the difference between LING+PV and LING+N2V is not statistically significative due to the high variance of the LING+PV results - see extended results table in the supplementary material).  our model outperforms any other model on both Stance and Hate Speech detection."
