Bold: best results or within std of them. ∗ indicates that the method's result is significantly better than all baseline methods, † indicates that the method's result is significantly better than all baselines methods that use the aspect-based data only, with p < 0.05 according to a one-tailed unpaired t-test. The data annotations S,  and A indicate training with Sentence-level, Noisy sentence-level and Aspect-level data respectively. Numbers for TDLSTM+Att,ATAE-LSTM,MM,RAM and LSTM+SynATT+TarRep are from (He et al., 2018a). Numbers for Semisupervised are from (He et al., 2018b)."
