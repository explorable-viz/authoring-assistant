      "value": "Table 1 compares the performance of all model variants. The SHiP models significantly improved over the BOW baselines on the two diagnosis tasks (p < 0.001 under Welch's t-test): for CCS prediction, the best SHiP models improved top-1 recall by 7.9 percentage points and top-5 recall by 4.8 percentage points, respectively, over the best BOW models; for ICD-9 prediction, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) increased by 2.1 percentage points and weighted area under the ROC curve (AUROC) increased by 0.8 percentage points. For mortality prediction, we saw negligible benefit from the SHiP architecture. The SHiP models also improved over the corresponding hierarchical models without pretraining. For mortality, pretraining the all-features model increased AUPRC by 0.8 percentage points (p = 0.06) and AUROC by 0.6 percentage points (p = 0.004); for primary CCS, pretraining the all-feature model increased top-1 recall by 8.0 percentage points (p < 0.001), while pretraining the notes-only model increased top-5 recall by 4.7 percentage points (p < 0.001); for all ICD-9, pretraining the notes-only model increased AUPRC by 0.7 percentage points (p = 0.03) and weighted AUROC by 0.4 percentage points (p = 0.01)."
