      "value": "We report the performance in probing tasks in Table 2.  In general, DCT yields better performance compared to averaging on all tasks, and larger K often yields improved performance in syntactic and semantic tasks. For the surface information tasks, SentLen and Word content (WC), c significantly outperforms AVG.  The performance decreased with increasing K in c[0 : K],  While increasing K has no positive effect on surface information tasks, syntactic and semantic tasks demonstrate performance gains with larger K. This trend is clearly observed in all syntactic tasks and three of the semantic tasks, where DCT performs well above AVG and the performance improves with increasing K. The only exception is SOMO, where increasing K actually results in lower performance, although all DCT results are still higher than AVG."
