The first row titled Count based (in Table 3) depicts the performance of a Hearst-like Pattern system baseline, that uses a frequency based threshold to classify candidate hyponym-hypernym pairs as positive (i.e. exhibiting hypernymy) or negative (i.e. not exhibiting hypernymy). The ppmi approach in Table 3 builds upon the Count based approach  by using Pointwise Mutual Information values for classification. SVD ppmi approach, the main contribution from Roller, Kiela, and Nickel (2018) builds low-rank embeddings of the PPMI matrix, which allows to make predictions for unseen pairs as well. HyperbolicCones is the SOTA (Le et al. 2019) in both these tasks. The final row reports the application of SPON (on the input provided by SVD ppmi) which is an original contribution of our work."
