The mixed datasets will be made available online  in a github repository. The performance of BERT on all datasets is displayed in Table 2.  the performance is the best for the En-En dataset. The performance on Fr-Fr and Jap-Jap is also very good as noted in the first experiment. We additionally note here that results on cross-lingual sets are close to monolingual results: either as good, or slightly worse or slightly better. For instance, the exact match on the En-Fr dataset is higher than the exact match on the Fr-Fr dataset. We also observe that, in general, the exact match and F1-score are close together when the context is in Japanese whereas there is generally a larger gap for the other two languages.  the performance on Jap-En is lower than on Jap-Jap whereas the performance on En-Fr is higher than on Fr-Fr,  Results for the Jap-Jap dataset are better than results for the Jap-En dataset"
