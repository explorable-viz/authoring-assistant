For detailed numbers of results on fewshot NOTA, please refer to Table 3.  (1) Treating NOTA as the  + 1 relation is beneficial for handling Few-Shot NOTA, though the results still fall fast when the NOTA rate increases. (2) BERT-PAIR works better under the NOTA setting for its binary-classification style model, and stays stable with rising NOTA rate. (3) Though BERT-PAIR achieves promising results, huge gaps still exist between the conventional (0% NOTA rate) and NOTA settings (gaps of 8 points for 5-way 1-shot and 7 points for 5way 5-shot with 50% NOTA rate), which calls for further research to address the challenge."
