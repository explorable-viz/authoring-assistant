As shown in the Table 4, the total recall of using only the QG module is 68.29%, while the recall of our proposed system, IWAQG, is 74.10%, an improvement of almost 6%. Furthermore, if we assume a perfect interrogative-word classifier, the recall would be 99.72%, a dramatic improvement which proves the validity of our hypothesis."
