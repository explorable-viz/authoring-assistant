      "value": "Table 2 and 3 compare the accuracies of our models to the results reported by several representative studies in frame-semantic parsing.  As can be seen from the tables, PAFIBERT outperformed other models on both the in-domain Das's test set and the out-of-domain YAGS test set, yielding new state-of-the-art results for frame identification. As expected, the results obtained with LU-based frame filtering were slightly better than those produced using target-based frame filtering, suggesting that a realistic setup is crucial in measuring model performance more precisely.  On Das's test set, for example, PAFIBERT achieved absolute improvements of 4-5% and 9% with frame filtering (Table 2) and without frame filtering (Table 3) respectively. As reported by , frame identification models usually suffer a drastic drop in performance when tested on out-of-domain data. The same trend was observed in our experiments for the YAGS test set. Nevertheless, PAFIBERT still outperformed existing methods by a large margin on this out-of-domain test set. Besides, in the more challenging setup that involved no frame filtering, the results obtained by PAFIBERT were on par with the prior state-of-the-art accuracies achieved with frame filtering."
