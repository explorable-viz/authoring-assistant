      "value": "The model performance and corresponding model size are reported in Table 5. On the one hand, removing the efficiency-aware loss (β = 0) leads to the increase in model parameter size, on the other hand, a more aggressive efficiency preference (β = 8) results in the small model size but degraded performance, since a large β encourages the compressed model to adopt more lightweight operations such as zero and skip which hurt the performance. A moderate efficiency constraint (β = 4) provides a regularization, guiding the AdaBERT method to achieve a trade-off between the small parameter size and the good performance."
