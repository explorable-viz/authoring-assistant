When comparing AR with AR+MMI, AR+MMI significantly outperforms AR across all metrics,  lookahead strategy to estimate For the variants of AR+MMI, AR+MMI+diverse generates a more diverse N-best list for reranking, and thus outperforms AR+MMI; AR+MMI+RL uses future and thus outperforms backward probability, AR+MMI as well.  It's hard to tell which model performs better, AR or non-AR: AR performs better than non-AR for BLEU and adversarial success, but worse for the other metrics. This means comparing with AR model, non-AR model tends to generate more diverse responses, but might be less coherent.  When comparing non-AR with AR+MMI+diverse, non-AR has relatively lower distinct score, but significantly higher scores BLEU and adversarial success."
