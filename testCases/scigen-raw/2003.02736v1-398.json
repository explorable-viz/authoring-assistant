(2019) (a GRU network with global attention) by 6 F1 points. We saw further gains in performance with PU learning, as well as when using PUC. Additionally, the models using PU learning had lower variance, indicating more consistent performance across runs. The best performing model we saw was the one trained using PUC with an F1 score of 0.826."
