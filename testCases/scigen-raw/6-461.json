The results of this comparison are summarized in Table 3 and show that syntactic rankers positioning the object second in the hierarchy (SE2 and SD2) lead to better alignment on both datasets and have a higher upper bound.  For English the global hierarchy-based ranker approaches the upper bound, closely followed by the pairwise ranker. The accuracy on German data is lower and the pairwise and local rankers outperform the global hierarchy-based ranker."
