While some correspondence to the hierarchies proposed for English Agent in literature is evident (e.g. ≺ Instrument ≺ Theme, similar to (Fillmore, 1968)), a direct comparison is impossible due to the differences in role definitions and underlying syntactic formalisms. Notice the high number of ties: some roles never co-occur (either by chance or by design) or occur on the same syntactic rank (e.g. oblique) so there is no evidence for preference even if we enforce transitivity."
