We report AP scores using three methods for cross-lingual word embedding induction, and compare their performance to two baselines: 1) random word pair scoring, and 2) the original (FASTTEXT) vectors. The results uncover the inability of distributional vectors to capture LE – they yield lower performance than the random baseline, which strongly emphasizes the need for the LE-specialization. The transferred POSTLE yields an immense improve"
