While the diseases and the drugs are all relevant, V600E and T790M are in fact not variants of the gene PIK3CA. However, when refining the query {PIK3CA, V600E, BRAF, H1047R, Dabrafenib}, the top ranked diseases are [Melanoma, Neoplasms, Carcinoma Non Small Cell Lung (CNSCL), Thyroid Neoplasms, Colorectal Neoplasms]. Using Melanoma for refinement, retrieves the top ranked paper (Falchook et al., 2013) which perfectly includes all these entities in a biomarker relationship."
