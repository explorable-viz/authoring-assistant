Likewise, the resampling results show that there is surprisingly little overlap in the test frames in 39 or 13 dimensions. In both cases the number of errors increases by a factor of [REPLACE id=\"result1\"] as we move from 39 dimensions to 13 dimensions which implies that there must be more separation in the models and the data in the 39-dimensional space."
