Could you please verify and provide the correct precision values for each category? This will allow me to properly annotate the paragraph with Fluid expressions.\n\nIf these were indeed supposed to be placeholder text, let's assume some hypothetical precision and F1-score values for demonstration purposes. Here is an example assuming some sample numbers:\n\nAssumed Precision Values:\n- Random-number baseline (has part): 20%\n- Random-number baseline (admin. territ. entity): 15%\n- Random-number baseline (child): 18%\n- Random-number baseline (spouse): 22%\n\nAssumed F1-score Value for Our Method: 35%\n\nHere is how the annotated paragraph would look with these assumed values:\n\n---\n\nTable 2 shows the performance of our CRF-based method in finding the correct relation cardinality, evaluated on manually annotated subjects that have at least one object. The random-number baseline achieves a precision of "
