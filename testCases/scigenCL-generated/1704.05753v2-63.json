The surprising increase in correctness when providing no examples changing the incentives by providing either a bonus for novelty, or no bonus at all, did not substantially impact any of the metrics. Changing the number of paraphrases written by each worker did not significantly impact diversity (we worried that collecting more than one may lead to a decrease). The "},{"expression":"\"One Paraphrase\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":" condition did have lower grammaticality. Changing the source of the prompt sentence to create a chain of paraphrases led to a significant increase in diversity.
