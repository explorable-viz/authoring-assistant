In the second group, we observe that the additional word-lookup model does not significantly improve the CNN model (from "},{"expression":"\"82.75\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":"% in CNN to "},{"expression":"\"82.90\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":"% in CNN+WORD on average) while the LSTM model is improved by a much larger margin (from "},{"expression":"\"81.48\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":"% in LSTM to "},{"expression":"\"82.56\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":"% in LSTM+WORD on average). This suggests that the CNN model has already learned the most important information from the word forms, while the LSTM model has not. Also, the combined CNN+WORD model is still "},{"expression":"\"better\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":" than the LSTM+WORD model, despite the large improvement in the latter. While comparing to the "},{"expression":"\"best\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":" published results (Björkelund et al., 2013, 2014), we have to note that their approach uses explicit morphological features, ensemble, ranking, etc., which all can boost parsing performance.
