Table 2 demonstrates the resulting performance (reflecting how close the predicted vectors are to the actual armed groups active in this or that location). Note that out of \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r pairs from 2001, \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r were already present in the previous data set (ongoing conflicts). This explains why the evaluation on all the pairs gives high results. However, even for the new conflicts, the projection performance is encouraging.\n\nSince there are no expressions meeting the criteria to be replaced, no Fluid expressions are annotated or added."
