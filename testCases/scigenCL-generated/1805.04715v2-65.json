It seems to have a repeated error message \"non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" which means \"is not recognized as an internal or external command.\" This appears to be an error message from the system, rather than part of the data being discussed.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the error messages are placeholders and should be ignored, there are no expressions that need annotation. The paragraph can remain unchanged:\n\nTable 4 presents \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r results on the second dataset for the \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r models identified on the first dataset. The LDA-Frames yielded the \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r results with our approach performing comparably in terms of the F1-score.\n\nIf there are actual values or expressions that need annotation within the paragraph (and not part of the error message), please provide a corrected version or clarify."
