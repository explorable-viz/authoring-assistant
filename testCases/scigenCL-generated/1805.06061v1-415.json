Table 1 also shows an ablation of the differences between SoPa and CNN: max-product semiring with sigmoid vs. max-sum semiring with identity, self-loops, and (cid:15)-transitions. The last line is equivalent to a CNN with  multiple window sizes. Interestingly, the most notable difference between SoPa and CNN is the semiring and encoder function, while (cid:15) transitions and self-loops have little effect on performance."}],"variables":{},"imports":["scigen","util","datasets/scigenCL/_1805_06061v1_415"],"datasets":["datasets/scigenCL/1805.06061v1-415.json"]}
