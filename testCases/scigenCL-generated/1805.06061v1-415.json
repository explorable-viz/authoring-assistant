Table 1 also shows an ablation of the differences between SoPa and CNN: max-product semiring with sigmoid vs. max-sum semiring with identity, self-loops, and (cid:15)-transitions. The last line is equivalent to a CNN with multiple window sizes. Interestingly, the most notable difference between SoPa and CNN is the semiring and encoder function, while (cid:15) transitions and self-loops have little effect on performance.\n\nNote: The phrase \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" seems to be an error message and not part of the actual text. It appears multiple times in the paragraph, and I left it as is without annotation since it doesn't seem relevant to the content you are interested in.\n\nIf this phrase should be removed or replaced with something meaningful, please let me know!"
