Assuming these are placeholders for some class names or event identifiers, and ignoring them for the purpose of detecting Fluid expressions, there are no explicit values, comparative expressions, or superlative/aggregated expressions present in this paragraph that can be annotated as per the given guidelines.\n\nIf we assume that each of these nonsensical phrases should represent an actual class name (e.g., \"ClassA\", \"ClassB\"), and hypothetically if we had a dataset with information on their distribution or values, then we would annotate those hypothetical expressions. Since no such information is provided and all relevant phrases appear to be erroneous, there are no Fluid expression annotations to make.\n\nIf you could provide the correct class names or any comparative/superlative statements about them, I'd be happy to help annotate the paragraph accordingly."
