Systems are evaluated using two types of precision, recall and F-score measures: strict MWE-based scores (every component of an MWE should be correctly tagged to be considered as true positive), and token-based scores (a partial match between a predicted and a gold MWE would be considered as true positive). We report results for all MWEs as well as discontinuous ones specifically. GCN-based "
