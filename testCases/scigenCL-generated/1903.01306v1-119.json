The paragraph contains a repeated phrase that appears to be an error message rather than actual data points. However, if we assume that this is a placeholder for actual values or references, I will illustrate how to handle it.\n\nFor example, let's assume the phrase \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" is actually a placeholder for performance metrics like F1-scores or accuracy. In that case, here is how you could annotate the paragraph if those placeholders were replaced with actual values:\n\nAssuming hypothetical values:\n- Without coarse-to-fine attention: 85%\n- Without KG or using word embeddings: 87%\n- When we removed GCNs: 86%\n\nThe annotated paragraph would look like this:\n\nFrom the evaluation results in Table 2, we observe that the performance "
