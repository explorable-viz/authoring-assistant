Therefore, no annotations can be made based on the given criteria.\n\nIf there were any specific values, comparisons, or superlatives mentioned, they would have been annotated accordingly. Here is the paragraph with no changes as no valid expressions were detected:\n\nAccording to the description in (CodaLab, 2019), the label distribution for dev and test sets are roughly \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r% for each of the emotions. However, from the dev set (Table 2) we know that the proportions of each of the emotion categories are \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r %5 each, thereby we use \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r as the empirical estimation of distribution Pte(xtr i ). We did not use the exact proportion of dev set as the estimation to prevent the overfitting towards dev set. The sample distribution of the train set is used as Ptr(xtr i )."
