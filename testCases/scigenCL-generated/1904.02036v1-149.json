If we assume this is an error and should be removed, the revised paragraph would look like:\n\n**Revised Paragraph:**\n\nTable 1 gives an overview of the historical datasets, covering languages from different language families\u2014as well as different text genres and time periods.\n\nSince there are no explicit values, comparative expressions, or superlative/aggregated expressions in the revised paragraph, no Fluid annotations are needed. If you intended to include some comparisons or specific numbers, please provide the corrected paragraph."
