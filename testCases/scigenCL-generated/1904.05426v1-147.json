We then take the next logical step and remove the parallel data-grounded embeddings, replacing them with fully unsupervised MUSE embeddings. Table 5 summarizes these results. It can be observed that POS signal improves performance greatly for all languages when using MUSE embeddings. Here we note a mixed result: whilst de, sv, and it do benefit from POS information, the other languages do not, obtaining "},{"expression":"\"great\"","type":"expression"},{"type":"literal","value":" improvements from MUSE embed dings instead.
