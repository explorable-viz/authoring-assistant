The text describes a classification process related to ellipsis examples in sentence-level translations and mentions an error message about the \"fluid\" command not being recognized, which is not relevant for conversion into Fluid expressions.\n\nTherefore, no replacements are needed:\n\nWe classified ellipsis examples which lead to errors in sentence-level translations by the type of error they cause. Results are provided in Table 4. From Table 4, we see that the \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno, types of ambiguity caused by the presence of an elliptical structure have different nature, hence we construct individual test sets for each of them."
