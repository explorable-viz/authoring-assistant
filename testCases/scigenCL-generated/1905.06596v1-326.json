The Table 1 presents a comparison of the translation quality measured via BLEU score between the currently dominant Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Dynamic Convolutions (Wu et al., 2019) models, as well as the work by He et al. (2018), which also proposes a joint encoder-decoder structure, and also other refinements over the transformer architecture like (Ahmed et al., 2017), (Chen et al., 2018), (Shaw et al., 2018) and (Ott et al., 2018).
