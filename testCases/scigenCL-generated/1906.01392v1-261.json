However, it is understood that \"not sufficient for obtaining optimal results\" is more like a description and should be noted explicitly when it is compared to similar phrases in the examples provided.\n\nSince there are no direct comparative expressions like \"better than\", \"worse\", or superlatives like \"the best\" present that can be directly replaced with Fluid expressions, we have kept them as they were except for correcting the repetitive phrase at the end."
