The lags make the problem clear: each position beyond the point where all source tokens have been read has its lag reduced by a certain amount, pulling the average lag below a certain threshold.\n\nSince there are no comparative expressions or explicit values (other than file paths that seem like an error) to annotate in this paragraph, here's what the output would look like if we were to strictly follow the task requirements:\n\nTable 1 shows the time-indexed lags that are averaged to calculate AL for a wait-3 system.
