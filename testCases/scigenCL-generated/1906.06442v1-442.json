However, there are no clear comparative or superlative expressions in this paragraph, and the only numeric value mentioned is not in a context where it represents a measurement or comparison that could be easily converted to a Fluid expression.\n\nHere is the annotated paragraph based on the instructions:\n\nTo understand how the model treats the tag and what biases it learns from the data, we investigate the entropy of the attention probability distribution, as well as the attention captured by the tag. For the tagged variants, there is heavy attention on the tag when it is present (Table 6), indicating that the model relies on the information signalled by the tag. Table 6 reports the average length-normalized Shannon entropy: The entropy of the attention probabilities from the model trained on BT data is "
