From the table, we can see that ODEE-FER achieves the highest F1 scores among all the methods. By comparing Nguyen et al. (2015) and ODEEF (p = 0.01), we can see that using continuous contextual features gives better performance than discrete features. Among ODEE models, ODEE-FE gives a 1% gain in F1 score against ODEE-F, there is a higher % gain in F1.\n\nNow, let's annotate the paragraph:\n\nTable 4 shows the overall performance of schema matching on GNBusinessTest.
