Assuming these are placeholders for actual performance numbers or a command that failed to execute, let's assume they should have been replaced with actual values (e.g., 95.23). Here is how it might look if those were valid numbers:\n\nThe answer is in Table II where we performed the same task, but this time we swapped our semantic segmentation network with the pixel-level ground-truth provided along with the data.
