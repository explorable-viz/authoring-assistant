Let's correct this and focus only on the relevant parts to be annotated with Fluid expressions.\n\nHere is the revised paragraph:\n\nTable VI shows the BLEU scores for the original/adversarial sentence (src) and their respective translation by the four NMT models. In Table VI, l1 denotes the BLSTM model under attack, l2 denotes the other BLSTM model, and ltrans are the Transformer counterparts of l1 and l2.\n\nNow let's annotate it:\n\nTable VI shows the BLEU scores for the original/adversarial sentence (src) and their respective translation by the four NMT models.
