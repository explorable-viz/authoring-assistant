The text seems to have some repeated and irrelevant lines about a command error related to \"fluid\", which appears to be causing issues in the system's recognition.\n\nHowever, if we focus on what makes sense and remove the erroneous repetitions, here is the cleaned-up version of the paragraph:\n\nWe then tested the BLEU scores between machine translation results and corresponding gold standard post-editing results on the original data as shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows that there is a significant gap between the eScape data set (Negri et al., 2018) and the real-life data sets.\n\nThere are no explicit numerical values, comparative phrases, or superlatives to annotate with Fluid expressions based on the provided paragraph. If you have additional information or corrected text, please provide it for further analysis."
