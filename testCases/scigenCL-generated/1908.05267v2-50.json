The statement is more about the analysis of biased phrases and bigrams within different dataset splits. Thus, there are no parts that can be directly replaced with Fluid expressions according to the given rules.\n\nHere's the unchanged text:\n\nThe correlation between the biased phrases in the two dataset splits is not as strong as in the REFUTE label, presented in the paper. However, one can notice that some of the biased bigrams in the training set, such as \"least one\" and \"starred movie\", translate to cues that can help in predictions over the development set.\n\nNo annotations are needed for this text."
