If this string is not supposed to be there, you might want to clean up the text before annotation. Otherwise, if it should be treated as part of the description, it would not typically be replaced by a Fluid expression as it doesn't correspond to a value, comparison, or superlative in the context provided.\n\nIf you need help with cleaning up this text or further annotation, please let me know!"
