The first row titled Count based (in Table 3) depicts the performance of a Hearst-like Pattern system baseline, that uses a frequency based threshold to classify candidate hyponym-hypernym pairs as positive (i.e. exhibiting hypernymy) or negative (i.e. not exhibiting hypernymy). The ppmi approach in Table 3 builds upon the Count based approach by using Pointwise Mutual Information values for classification. SVD ppmi approach, the main contribution from Roller, Kiela, and Nickel (2018) builds low-rank embeddings of the PPMI matrix, which allows to make predictions for unseen pairs as well.
