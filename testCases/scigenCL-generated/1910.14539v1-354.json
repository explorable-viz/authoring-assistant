Interestingly, relying on position only and removing most tags (e.g.,  ,  ) seems to be fine. In this case, we also print all-zero stats, for the position of each statistic to be consistent across players and games.\n\nNote: The path `\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\"` appears in the text but it does not seem to correspond to a specific value or comparative/superlative expression, hence it was not replaced. If \"non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" is an output from running `fluid` and represents a value or status, it would be treated differently, but as stated, it seems more like an error message and not something to replace with Fluid syntax in this context."
