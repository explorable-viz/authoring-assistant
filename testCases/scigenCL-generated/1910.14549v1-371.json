As reported by , frame identification models usually suffer a drastic drop in performance when tested on out-of-domain data. The same trend was observed in our experiments for the YAGS test set. Nevertheless, PAFIBERT still outperformed existing methods by a large margin on this out-of-domain test set. Besides, in the more challenging setup that involved no frame filtering, the results obtained by PAFIBERT were "
