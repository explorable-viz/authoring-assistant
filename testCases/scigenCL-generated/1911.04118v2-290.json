Since this doesn't fit into the types of expressions we are looking for, it will remain unchanged.\n\nThe dataset names ASNQ and NAD mentioned later in the text can be considered explicit values, so I'll annotate those:\n\nTable 8: Comparison between \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r and \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r on real-world datasets derived from Alexa Virtual Assistant traffic\r\nIn these experiments, we used, as usual, \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r for the transfer step, and \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r as our target dataset for the adapt step.
