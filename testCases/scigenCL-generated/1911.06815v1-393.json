Table 1 (right) shows that using additional information from the sentence-level for the token-level classification (BERT-Granularity) yields improvements. The multi-granularity models outperform all baselines thanks to their precision. This shows the effect of the model excluding sentences that it determined to be non-propagandistic from being considered for token-level classification. The right side of Table 1 shows the results for the SLC task. We apply our multi-granularity network model to the sentence-level classification task to see its effect on low granularity when we train the model with a high granularity task. Interestingly, it yields performance improvements on the sentence-level classification result. Compared to the BERT baseline, it increases the recall by "
