    "value": "First, we represent utterances by their \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" representations as feature-vectors. We then supply the vector representation of each utterance to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for domain and intent identification, and to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for slot filling. Second, we encode words in a dialogue utterance by \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\" as benchmark pre-trained word embeddings, to include the semantic relationships among words. We compute the average of word embeddings in an utterance to represent the utterance by a vector. Table 2 shows the performance of the described models.\n\n**Note:** There are no explicit values, comparative expressions, or superlative/aggregated expressions detected in this paragraph that can be replaced with Fluid expressions based on the given task description and format. The paragraph discusses methods and procedures without providing specific data points or comparisons."
