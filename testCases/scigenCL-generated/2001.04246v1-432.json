We then leverage Data Augmentation (DA) to enrich task-oriented knowledge and this technique also improves performance for all tasks, especially for tasks that have a limited scale of data (i.e., MRPC and RTE). DA is also adopted in existing KD-based compression studies (Tang et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2019). When taking the supervised label knowledge (\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\") into consideration, the performance is further boosted, showing that this term is also important for AdaBERT by providing focused search hints.\n\n**Note:** The path in the text (\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,) does not appear to be a valid explicit value, comparative expression, or superlative/aggregated expression as per the rules given. Therefore, it is left as-is and not replaced with a Fluid expression."
