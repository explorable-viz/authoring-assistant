The paragraph discusses character embeddings and their impact on performance but does not include specific scores or direct comparisons between different architectures/models.\n\nHere's how we would handle this if it were to contain such information:\n\nExample of what the output might look like if there were comparable values:\n```\nTo illustrate the need of pre-trained character embeddings, we see from III that using a "
