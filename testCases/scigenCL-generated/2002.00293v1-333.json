To measure this, we evaluate the performance of two models of identical setup for each respective architecture, which differ only in their random initialisation and data order during SGD sampling. We can thus isolate how strongly the resulting dataset depends on the particular random initialisation and order of data points used to train the model. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 4.\n\nIn this case, \"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" is not an expression that can be replaced by a Fluid expression according to the task description. It appears to be a path to a command and thus does not fit into any of the categories (explicit values, comparative expressions, or superlative/aggregated expressions). Therefore, it remains unchanged in the output."
