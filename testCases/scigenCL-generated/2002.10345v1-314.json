Due to the limitation of our devices, we only conduct an experiment on two text classification datasets and one NLI dataset and evaluate strategy BERTSDA, namely self-distillation with averaged BERT as a teacher. We set two different teacher sizes for comparison. As shown in Table 4, self-distillation also gets a significant gain while fine-tuning the BERT-large model. On two text classification tasks, BERT-LSDA(K = −1) gives better results and the average improvement is 7.02%. For NLI task, BERT-LSDA(K = 1) gives better result and the improvement is 6.59%.\n\nAnnotated output:\n\nWe also investigate whether self-distillation has similar findings for the BERTlarge model (BERT-L), which contains "
