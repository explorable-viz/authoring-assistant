Zero-shot learning reaches an F1 score of [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r]% in the MEDIUM setup, which outperforms training the neural tagger on very limited gold data (plain). Neural NER is [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r] than traditional HMM-based tagging (TnT) (Brants, 2000) and greatly improves by unsupervised word embedding initialization (+Poly). It is noteworthy that zero-shot transfer benefits only to a limiting degree from more source data (F1 increases by almost [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r]% when training on all English CoNLL data). To compare cross-lingual transfer to limited gold data (RQ2), we observe that training the neural system on the small amount of data together with Polyglot embeddings is close to the tiny-shot transfer setup. Few-shot learning greatly improves over zero-shot learning. The [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r] way is to add the target data to the source, in comparison to fine-tuning. In both MEDIUM and LARGE setups are further gains obtained by adding TINY or SMALL amounts of Danish gold data. Interestingly, a) finetuning is less effective; b) it is "
