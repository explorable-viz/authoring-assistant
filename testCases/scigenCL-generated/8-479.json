In the DISJOINT setting, however, LEAR is left \"blind\" as it has not seen a single test word in the constraints: it leaves distributional vectors of *BLESS test words identical. In this setting, LEAR performance is equivalent to [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r] distributional space. In contrast, learning to generalize the LE specialization function from LEAR-specializations of other words, POSTLE models are able to successfully LE-specialize vectors of test *BLESS words. As in the graded LE, the adversarial POSTLE architecture [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r] the simpler DFFN model.\n\nNote that in this paragraph, the Fluid-related error message appears three times and is not directly related to any comparative or superlative expressions. Therefore, I have only replaced it with [REPLACE value=\"C:\\Users\\Alfy\\Lavoro\\bristol\\transp-text-new\\node_modules\\.bin\\fluid\" non � riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,\r] where applicable in the context of performance comparisons."
