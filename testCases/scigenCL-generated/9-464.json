In Figure 3 we show the correlation between the different models. Interestingly, the bm25 and the feat strongly correlate. However, the scores of bm25 do not correlate with the scores of the combination of auto-rank and bm25. This indicates that the model does not primarily learn to use the bm25 score but also focuses on the the auto-encoded representation. This underlines the hypothesis that the auto-encoder is able to represent latent features of the relationship of the query terms in the document. rank model. The distance features are a strong indicator for the semantic dependency between entities. These relationships need to be learned in the auto-rank model. The cosine similarity of a query and a document (auto/cos) does not yield a good result. This shows that the auto-encoder has learned many features, most of which do not correlate with our task.
