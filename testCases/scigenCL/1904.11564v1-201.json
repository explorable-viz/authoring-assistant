Generation quality is primarily evaluated with BLEU  Semi-supervised training  leads to an 11 BLEU point improvement  compar  train  In addition to BLEU, we also report exact match accuracy on the overlapping subset. Results show that our neural models outperform the grammar-based generator by a large margin."
