SynST achieves speedups of ∼ 4 − 5× that of the vanilla Transformer, which is larger than nearly all  of the SAT configurations. Quality-wise, SynST again significantly outperforms the SAT configurations at comparable speedups on all datasets. On WMT En-De, SynST improves by 1 BLEU over LT (20.74 vs LT's 19.8 without reranking)."
