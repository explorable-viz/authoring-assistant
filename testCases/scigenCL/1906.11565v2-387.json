In terms of label distribution for both datasets, Neutral are the most common class, followed by Joy, Sadness, and Anger. Both datasets have imbalanced class distribution, and especially the ratio of Sadness and Anger is very small. For instance, they account for only 3.4% and 5.2%, respectively in the Friends dataset. In the case of EmotionPush, Anger label accounts for less than 1% of the training set."
