            "value": "For each of the most biased words in SNLI associated with the CONTRADICTION label, we computed the probability that a model predicts an example as a contradiction, given that the hypothesis contains the word. Table 3 shows the top 10 examples in the training set. For each word w, we give its frequency in SNLI, its empirical correlation with the label and with InferSent's prediction, and the percentage decrease in correlations with CONTRADICTION predictions by three configurations of our methods. Generally, the baseline correlations are more uniform than the empirical ones (ˆp(l|w)),  However, we still observed small skews towards CONTRADICTION. Thus, we investigate whether our methods reduce the probability of predicting CONTRADICTION when a hypothesis contains an indicator word. The model trained with AdvDat (where λRand = 0.4, λEnc = 1) predicts contradiction much less frequently than InferSent on examples with these words."
