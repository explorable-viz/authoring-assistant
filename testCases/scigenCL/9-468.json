We also compute Recall@k of relevant documents for automatically refined queries using the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ranked entities. The scores can be found in Table 5. Tables 4 and 5 show that the Relevance Model outperforms the Rocchio algorithm in every aspect. Both models outperform the auto-encoder approach (auto-ref ). We suspect that summing over the encodings distorts the individual features too much for a correct extraction of relevant entities to be possible. The combination of all three models (auto-ref + rocchio + relevance) outperforms the other models in most cases. Especially the performance for ranking of entity terms is increased using the autoencoded features. However, it is interesting to see that the rocchio + relevance model outperforms the recall for second and third best terms. This indicates that for user-evaluated term suggestions, the inclusion of the auto-encoded features is advisable. For automatic query refinement however, in average, this is not the case."
