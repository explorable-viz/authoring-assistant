	The  ${"results"}  of all  ${"four"}  logistic regression models are shown in  ${"Table 5"} .  The  ${"results"}  for the  ${"full dataset"}  are fully consistent with the findings shown in  ${"Table 5"} : there was no significant effect of  ${"surprisal"}  on referring expression type.  In order to replicate their settings as closely as possible, we also included  ${"residualEntropy"}  as a predictor in our model (see last predictor in  ${"Table 5"} ); however, this did not change the  ${"results"} .
