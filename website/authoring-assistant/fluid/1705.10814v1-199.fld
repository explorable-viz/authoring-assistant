"""
	Table 2 shows the results, where the two cases are denoted as  ${"ΔIV"}  and  ${"ΔOOV"} . The general trend in the results is that the improvements of both models in the  ${"OOV"}  case are larger than in the  ${"IV"}  case, which means that the character composition models indeed alleviates the OOV problem. Also,  ${"CNN"}  improves on seven languages in the  ${"IV"}  case and eight languages in the  ${"OOV"}  case, and it performs consistently  ${"better"}  than  ${"LSTM"}  in both cases.
