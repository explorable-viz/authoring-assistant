"""
	The results, shown in Table 3, demonstrate that the MIMICK RNN recovers about  ${if 17.5 >= 8.7 then "half" else ""}  of the loss in performance incurred by the original Polyglot training model due to out-of-vocabulary words in the "All pairs" condition. MIMICK also  ${"outperforms"}  VarEmbed. FastText can be considered an upper bound: with a vocabulary that is  ${"25 times larger"}  than the other models, it was missing words from only  ${"44 pairs"}  on this data.
