"""
	Table 1 demonstrates the effect of computing BLEU scores with different reference tokenizations.  The changes in each column show the effect these different schemes have, as high as  ${"1.8"}  for one arc, and averaging around  ${"1.0"} . The biggest is the treatment of case, which is well known, yet many papers are not clear about whether they report cased or case-insensitive BLEU.  The variations in Table 1 are only some of the possible configurations, since there is no limit to the preprocessing that a group could apply.
