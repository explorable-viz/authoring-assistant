"""
	Results on the MSRA dataset are shown in Table 6.  Our chosen segmentor gives  ${"95.93"} % accuracy on  ${"5-fold cross-validated training set"} .  Compared with the existing methods, our wordbased and character-based LSTM-CRF models give competitive accuracies. The lattice model significantly outperforms both the  ${"best characterbased and word-based models"}  (p < 0.01), achieving the  ${"best result"}  on this standard benchmark.
