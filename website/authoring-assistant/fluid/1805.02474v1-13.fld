"""
	As can be seen in Table 6,  ${(findWhere (fun x -> x.model == "S-LSTM") tableData).model}  gives  ${"significantly better"}  results compared with  ${(findWhere (fun x -> x.model == "BiLSTM") tableData).model}  on the  ${"WSJ dataset"} . It also gives  ${"competitive accuracies"}  as compared with existing methods in the literature. Stacking two layers of  ${"BiLSTMs"}  leads to  ${"improved results"}  compared to one-layer  ${(findWhere (fun x -> x.model == "BiLSTM") tableData).model} , but the accuracy does not further improve  with three layers of stacked LSTMs.
