"""
	Tables 1 and 2 show the performance of  ${"DialogWAE"}  and  ${"baselines"}  on the two datasets.  ${"DialogWAE"}  outperforms the  ${"baselines"}  in the majority of the experiments. In terms of BLEU scores,  ${"DialogWAE (with a Gaussian mixture prior network)"}  generates more relevant responses, with the average recall of  ${"42.0%"}  and  ${"37.2%"}  on both of the datasets. These are significantly  ${"higher"}  than those of the  ${"CVAE baselines"}  ( ${"29.9%"}  and  ${"26.5%"} ). We observe a similar trend to the BOW embedding metrics.
