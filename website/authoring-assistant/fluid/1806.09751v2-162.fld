"""
	We designed ESE to output  ${"thirty"}  candidate entities (NPs) ranked based on the similarity to the seed term. Therefore, we calculated precision at k (p@k) where k is always  ${numToStr 30} .  Table 2 shows the  ${rankLabel "best" 1}  results when using the feature ensemble method which is  ${"more stable"}  than the non-ensemble one (due to  ${"lower standard deviation"}  and  ${let nonZeroPrecision = "non-zero precision" in nonZeroPrecision} ). According to the results, the best combination in terms of the  ${"mean"}  and  ${let sd = "standard deviation" in sd}  is obtained when using TFIDF (Eq.5) to weigh the edges and context-dependent similarity (Eq.8) to rank NPs. This shows that the uniqueness and the significant overlap of features between noun phrases were very important.
