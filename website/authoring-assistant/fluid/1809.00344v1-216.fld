"""
	We conduct an ablation study to validate our hypothesis of using the complete context versus using only one of the three types of contexts in a bilingual multi-speaker conversation: (i)  ${"current turn"} , (ii)  ${"previous turns in current language"} , and (iii)  ${"previous turns in the other language"} . The results for En-De are reported in Table 4. We see  ${"decrease in BLEU"}  for all types of contexts with significant decrease when considering only current language from previous turns.The results show that the  ${let contextType = "Current Turn"
in if contextType == "Current Turn" then "current turn" else ""}  has the most influence on translating a sentence,
