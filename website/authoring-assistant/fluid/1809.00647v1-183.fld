"""
	We inspect some pairs of events and entities in different kernels and list some examples in  ${"Table 5"} .  The pairs in  ${"Table 3"}  exhibit interesting types of relations: e.g.,"arrest-charge" and "attack-kill" form script-like chains; " ${"911"}  attack" forms a quasiidentity relation (Recasens et al., 2010) with "attack"; "business" and "increase" are candidates as frame-argument structure.
