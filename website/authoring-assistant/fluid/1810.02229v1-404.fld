	Results for the experiments are illustrated in Table 3.  The network obtains  ${"the best"}  F1 score, both for detection (F1 of  ${"0.880"}  for strict evaluation and  ${"0.903"}  for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings) and for classification (F1-class of  ${"0.756"}  for strict evaluation, and  ${"0.751"}  for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings).  Although FBKHLT suffers in the classification subtask, it qualifies as a highly competitive system for the detection subtask.  By observing the strict F1 scores, FBK-HLT  ${"beats"}   ${"three"}  configurations (DH-FBK100, ILC-ItWack, Berardi2015 Glove) 11, almost  ${"equals"}  one (Berardi2015 w2v) 12, and it is  ${"outperformed"}  only by one (Fastext-It) 13. In the relaxed evaluation setting, DH-FBK-100 is the only configuration that does not  ${"beat"}  FBK-HLT (although the difference is only  ${"0.001"}  point). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to observe that FBK-HLT has a very high Precision ( ${"0.902"} , relaxed evaluation mode), that is  ${"overcome"}  by only one embedding configuration, ILC-ItWack. The results also indicates that word embeddings have a major contribution on Recall,  these results are obtained using a single step approach,
