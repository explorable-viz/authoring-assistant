"""
	see We that using phonological representations (phonemes and articulatory features) offers the ability to map between languages that use different orthographies, explaining the convincing improvement over graphemes for HRL-LRL pairs that are written in different scripts (Table 3). With graphemes, the experiments on these languages achieve ≈  ${"0"}  accuracy because the character vocabulary of the HRL encoder simply does not contain the low-resource test language characters. This is the case with  ${"Lao-Thai (lo-th)"} ,  ${"Telugu-Tamil (te-ta)"}  and  ${"Bengali-Hindi (bn-hi)"} . In contrast, we observe that the grapheme representation offers strong transfer performance when the LRL and HRL share orthography, notably  ${"Javanese-Indonesian (jv-id)"} ,  ${"Marathi-Hindi (mr-hi)"}  and  ${"Ukrainian-Russian (uk-ru)"} .
