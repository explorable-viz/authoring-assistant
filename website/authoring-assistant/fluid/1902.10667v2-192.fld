"""
	we show the superior performance (in terms of  ${"MWE-based F-score"} ) of our  ${"top systems"}  on the test data compared to the baseline and stateof-the-art systems, namely,  ${"ATILF-LLF (Al Saied et al., 2017)"}  and  ${"SHOMA (Taslimipoor and Rohanian, 2018)"} .  ${"GCN"}  works the  ${"best"}  for discontinuous MWEs in  ${"EN and FA"} , while  ${"H-combined"}  outperforms based on results for all MWEs except for  ${"FA"} .  The overall results confirm our assumption that a hybrid architecture can mitigate errors of individual models and bolster their strengths.
