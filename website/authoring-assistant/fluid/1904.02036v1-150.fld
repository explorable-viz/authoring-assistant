"""
	Table 2 shows the results of this evaluation. The extent of spelling variation varies  greatly between datasets, with less than 15% of tokens requiring normalization (SLG) to more than 80% (HU). The maximum accuracy is above 97% for most datasets,  For the normalization systems, we observe significantly better word accuracy with SMT than NMT on four of the datasets, and non-significant differences on five others. There is only one dataset (DEA) where the NMT system by Tang et al. (2018) gets significantly better word accuracy than other systems.  Overall, the deep NMT model by Tang et al. (2018) consistently outperforms the shallow one by Bollmann (2018).  Finally, while Norma does produce competitive results on sev  eral datasets (particularly in the "combined" setting), it is generally significantly behind the SMT and NMT methods.
