	We  ${"compare"}  the classification accuracy of our model against several other recent methods (Table 3).  Our model outperforms  ${"state-of-the-art methods"}  by  ${"1.6%"}  on SwDA, the primary dataset for this task, and comes within  ${"0.6%"}  on MRDA. It also  ${"beats"}  a TF-IDF GloVe baseline (described in Section 5.2) by  ${"16.4%"}  and  ${"12.2%"} , respectively.  The improvements that the model is able to make over the other methods are significant, however, the gains on MRDA still fall short of the  ${"state-of-the-art"}  by  ${"0.6%"} .
