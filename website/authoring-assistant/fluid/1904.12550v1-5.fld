"""
	For TOP n COS SIM AVG, the tuning data results (Table 2) are somewhat more varied: First, there is no single best performing set of embeddings: Google yields the best F score for the Label setting ( ${numToStr (findWithKey' "concept_input____embeddings" "Google" tableData).label___f} ), while GloVe (though only barely) leads in the Description setting ( ${numToStr (findWithKey' "concept_input____embeddings" "GloVe" tableData).description___f} ). This time, it is fastText which produces the best F score in the Both setting, which is also the best overall tuning data F score for TOP n COS SIM AVG ( ${numToStr (findWithKey' "concept_input____embeddings" "fastText" tableData).both___f} ).
