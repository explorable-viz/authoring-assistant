	We classified ellipsis examples which lead to errors in sentence-level translations by the type of error they cause. Results are provided in  ${"Table 4"} . From  ${"Table 4"} , we see that the two most frequent types of ambiguity caused by the presence of an elliptical structure have different nature, hence we construct individual test sets for each of them.
