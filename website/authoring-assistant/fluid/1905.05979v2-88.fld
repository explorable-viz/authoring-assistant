"""
	For all tasks, we observe a large improvement from using context. For deixis, the concatenation model (concat) and CADec improve over the baseline by 33.5 and 31.6 percentage points, respectively. On the lexical cohesion test set, CADec shows a large improvement over the context-agnostic baseline (12.2 percentage points), while concat performs similarly to the baseline.  When looking only at the scores where the latest relevant context is in the model's context window (column 2 in Table 7), s-hier-to-2.tied outperforms the concatenation baseline for lexical cohesion, but remains behind the performance of CADec.
