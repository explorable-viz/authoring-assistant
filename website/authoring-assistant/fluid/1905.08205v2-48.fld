"""
	As shown in Table 3, there are at least 6.6% and up to 14.4% absolute improvements on accuracy of exact matching on the development set. For example, when SyntaxSQLNet is learned to generate SemQL queries instead of SQL queries, it registers 8.6% absolute improvement and even outperforms SyntaxSQLNet(augment) which performs largescale data augmentation.  Table 4 presents the ablation study results. It is clear that our base model significantly outperforms SyntaxSQLNet, SyntaxSQLNet( augment) and SyntaxSQLNet(BERT). Performing schema linking ('+SL') brings about 8.5% and 6.4% absolute improvement on IRNet and IRNet(BERT).  The F1 score on the WHERE clause increases by 12.5% when IRNet performs schema linking.  The number of examples suffering from this problem decreases by 70%, when using the memory augmented pointer network.
