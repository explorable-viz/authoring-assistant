"""
	The results are shown in  ${"Table 2"}  ('Wikipedia'). The resulting model is significantly  ${"less accurate"}  than the one which used  ${"unlabeled documents"} . The  ${"score difference"}  is  ${"larger"}   for  ${"AIDA-CoNLL test set"}  than for the other  ${"5"}  test sets.  Additionally we train our model on  ${"AIDA-CoNLL"} , producing its fully-supervised version (' ${"AIDA CoNLL"} ' row in Table 2). Though, as expected, this version is  ${"more accurate"}  on AIDA test set, similarly to other fully-supervised methods, it overfits and does not perform that well on the  ${"5"}  out-of-domain test sets.
