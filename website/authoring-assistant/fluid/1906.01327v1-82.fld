	we reorganized the train/dev/test sets, forming new splits, which we refer to as  ${"NO-LEAK F&C"} . The new split sizes can be found in Table 2. We re-ran the current models on  ${"NO-LEAK F&C"}  and, as expected, we observe a drop of  ${"5-6%"}  in accuracy: from the original  ${"76%"}  accuracy on the dev/test sets, to  ${"70%"}  and  ${"71%"}  accuracy, respectively.
