	Table 1 contains the results on  ${"all four"}  datasets.  ${"SynST"}  achieves speedups of ∼  ${"4 − 5×"}  that of the vanilla Transformer, which is larger than nearly all of the  ${"SAT configurations"} . Quality-wise,  ${"SynST"}  again significantly  ${"outperforms"}  the  ${"SAT configurations"}  at comparable speedups on all datasets. On WMT En-De,  ${"SynST"}  improves by  ${"1"}  BLEU over LT ( ${"20.74"}  vs LT's  ${"19.8"}  without reranking).
