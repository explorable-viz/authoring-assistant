"""
	We conduct an ablation study to further analyze our reinforcement learning algorithm. The results are reported in  ${"Table 5"} .  As seen in Table 5, although the performance of  ${"catSeq-RF1"}  is  ${"competitive"}  to  ${"catSeq-2RF1"}  on predicting present keyphrases, it yields an extremely  ${"poor"}  performance on absent keyphrase prediction.  By comparing the last two rows in Table 5, we observe that our RF1 reward function slightly  ${"outperforms"}  the F1 reward function.
