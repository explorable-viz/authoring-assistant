"""
	The  ${"BLEU"}  scores of each decoding method are presented in Table 7.  The  ${"noised decode"}  – decoding newstest sentences with the  ${"NoisedBT"}  model after noising the source – yields poor performance.  The  ${"tagged decode"}  , however, yields only somewhat  ${"lower"}  performance than the  ${"standard decode"}  on the same model ( ${"-2.9"}  BLEU on average).
