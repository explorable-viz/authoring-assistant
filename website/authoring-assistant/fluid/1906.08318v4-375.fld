"""
	No statistical significance is seen even when the test set result  ${"worsens"}  in performance for  ${"BERTCLS"}  and  ${let datasetName = "Piecewise Pool" in datasetName}  in table 5 where it  ${"hurts"}  test set performance on  ${"ddi"}  but is not statistically significant when cross validation is performed.  In table 5, we tested the generalizability of the commonly used piecewise pooling technique  While piecewise pooling helps i2b2 by  ${"1%"} , it  ${"hurts"}  test set performance on ddi and doesn't affect performance on semeval.  We found ELMo and BER tokens to  ${"boost"}  performance significantly for all datasets, but that BERT-CLS hurt performance for the medical datasets. While BERT-CLS  ${"boosted"}  test set performance for semeval, this was not found to be a statistically significant difference for cross validation.
