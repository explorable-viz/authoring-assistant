"""
	The main results of our experiments are shown in Table 1.  We notice that  ${"M.1"}  ( ${"Bag-of-words + Logistic Regression"} ) and  ${"M.2"}  ( ${"BiLSTM"} ) show a statistically significant  ${"difference"}  between the two genders, with  ${"higher"}  predicted positive class probabilities for sentences with female nouns.  On the contrary,  ${"M.3"}  ( ${"BERT"} ) shows that sentences with male nouns have a statistically significant  ${"higher"}  predicted positive class probability than sentences with female nouns.
