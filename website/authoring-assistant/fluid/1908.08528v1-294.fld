	In  ${"Table 3"} , we compare the combined distance measure with each of the two components used alone. The results show that combining the  ${"edit distance"}  with the  ${"embedding similarity"}  is  ${"stronger"}  than using any of the measures alone.  The  ${"embedding similarity"}  alone performs much  ${"better"}  than the  ${"edit distance"}  alone.
