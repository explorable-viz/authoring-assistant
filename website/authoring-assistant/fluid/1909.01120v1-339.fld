"""
	We report the quality results in  ${"Table 2"} , where each number represents the fraction of tests passed. While on  ${"average"}  the local embeddings for  ${"EmbDI"}  are largely  ${"superior"}  to the baseline, our solution is beaten once for  ${"MA"} . By increasing the percentage of row permutations in  ${"Basic"} , results for  ${"MR"}  improve but decrease for  ${"MA"} , without significant benefit for  ${"MC"} .
