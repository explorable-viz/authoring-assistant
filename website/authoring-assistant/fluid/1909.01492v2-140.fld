	The allowable input perturbation space is much  ${"larger"}  than for word-level synonym substitutions, as shown in Table 3.  In Table 3, we show the  ${"maximum"}  perturbation space size in the SST and AG News test set for different perturbation radii δ.  This number grows exponentially as δ increases.
