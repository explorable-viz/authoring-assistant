"""
	Table 4 shows the  ${rankLabel "best" 1}  results for the various models as reported in Kayal and Tsatsaronis (2019), in addition to the best performance of our model denoted as c. Note that the DCT-based model, DCT*, described in Kayal and Tsatsaronis (2019) performed  ${"relatively poorly"}  in all tasks, while our model achieved close to  ${"state-of-the-art performance"}  in both the 20-NG and R-8 tasks. Our model outperformed EignSent on all tasks and generally performed  ${"better than or on par with"}  p-means, ELMo, BERT, and EigenSent⊕Avg on both the 20-NG and R-8. On the other hand, both EigenSent⊕Avg and ELMo performed  ${betterWorse (GT)}  than all other models on SST-5.
