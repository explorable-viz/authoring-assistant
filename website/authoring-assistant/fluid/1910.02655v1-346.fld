"""
	Table 1 compares the development set performance of different variants of the proposed sentence retrieval method with the state of the art results on the FEVER dataset. The results indicate that both pointwise and pairwise  ${"BERT"}  sentence retrieval improve the  ${"recall"} . The  ${"UNC"}  and  ${"DREAM"}  precision scores are  ${"better"}  than our methods without a decision threshold, however, a threshold can regulate the trade-off between the recall and precision, and achieve the  ${"best"}  precision and  ${"F1"}  scores.
