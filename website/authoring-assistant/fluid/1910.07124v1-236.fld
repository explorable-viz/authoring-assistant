	Table 2 demonstrates the evaluation results of few-shot DA on the existing FewRel  ${"test"}  set and the new  ${"test"}  set.  (1) All few-shot models suffer dramatic  ${"performance falls"}  when tested on a different  ${"domain"} . (2) Adversarial training does improve the results on the new  ${"test domain"} , yet still has large space for growth. (3) BERT-PAIR outperforms all other few-shot models on both  ${"1.0"}  and  ${"2.0"}  test set.
