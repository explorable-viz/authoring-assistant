	Table  ${"3"}  summarizes the results for these transfer learning experiments when the source task is  ${"MNLI"} . Gain shows the  ${"difference"}  between  ${"Fine-tuned model's accuracy"}  and  ${"Baseline's accuracy"} . For  ${"HUBERT"}  (Transformer), we observe substantial  ${"gain"}  across all  ${"5"}  target corpora after transfer. However, for  ${"BERT"}  we have a  ${"drop"}  for  ${"QNLI"} ,  ${"QQP"} , and  ${"SST"} .
