"""
	First, we  ${"represent"}  utterances by their  ${"TF-IDF"}  representations as feature-vectors. We then supply the vector representation of each utterance to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for domain and intent identification, and to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for slot filling. Second, we  ${"encode"}  words in a dialogue utterance by  ${"GLoVe"} , as benchmark pre-trained word embeddings, to include the semantic relationships among words. We compute the  ${"average"}  of word embeddings in an utterance to represent the utterance by a vector. Table 2 shows the performance of the described models.
