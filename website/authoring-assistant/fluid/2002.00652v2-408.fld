"""
	Taking CONCAT as a representative, we compare the performance of our model with other models, as shown in  ${"Table " ++ numToStr 1} . As illustrated, our model outperforms baselines by a large margin with or without BERT, achieving new  ${rankLabel "SOTA" 1}  performances on both datasets. Compared with the previous SOTA without BERT on SPARC, our model improves Ques.Match and Int.Match by  ${"10.6"}  and  ${"5.4 points"} , respectively.
