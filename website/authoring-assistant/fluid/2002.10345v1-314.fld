	We also investigate whether self-distillation has similar findings for the  ${"BERTlarge"}  model ( ${"BERT-L"} ), which contains  ${"24"}  Transformer layers. Due to the limitation of our devices, we only conduct an experiment on two text classification datasets and one NLI datasets and evaluate strategy  ${"BERTSDA"} , namely self-distillation with averaged BERT as a teacher. We set two different teacher sizes for comparison. As shown in Table 4, self-distillation also gets a significant gain while fine-tuning the  ${"BERT-large"}  model. On two text classification tasks,  ${"BERT-LSDA(K =  − 1)"}  gives  ${"better"}  results and the average improvement is  ${"7.02"} %.
For NLI task,  ${"BERT-LSDA(K = 1)"}  gives  ${"better"}  result and the improvement is  ${"6.59"} %.
