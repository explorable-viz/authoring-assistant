"""
	For TOP n COS SIM AVG, the tuning data results (Table 2) are somewhat more varied: First, there is no single best performing set of embeddings: Google yields the best F score for the Label setting ( ${(findWithKey_ "_Concept_Input_Embeddings" "Google" tableData)._Label_F} ), while GloVe (though only barely) leads in the Description setting ( ${(findWithKey_ "_Concept_Input_Embeddings" "GloVe" tableData)._Description_F} ). This time, it is fastText which produces the best F score in the Both setting, which is also the best overall tuning data F score for TOP n COS SIM AVG ( ${(findWithKey_ "_Concept_Input_Embeddings" "fastText" tableData)._Both_F} ).
